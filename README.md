# CFDTOOLS

## Overview
The CFD Utility Software Library, a.k.a. CFDTOOLS, contains nearly 30 numerical
analysis libraries and close to 100 utility applications built upon those
libraries. These utilities were developed over a roughly fifty year span to
support aerospace research and development activities at NASA Ames Research
Center (ARC). They are mostly written in Fortran 90 or 77 and are designed with
potential reuse in mind. The library also includes C translations of roughly a
dozen numerics routines in the `C_utilities` module.

The library began as the ARC Aerodynamics Division Software Library, and is
currently maintained by ARC Entry Systems and Technology Division. David
Saunders and Robert Kennelly are the primary authors, with miscellaneous
contributions from many others over the years. CFDTOOLS is expected to grow
slowly as new functionality is required.


## Feature Summary
* Single-function tools for manipulating multiblock grids and flow solutions
* Rapid searching/interpolation for structured or unstructured grids (ADT methods)
* Automated gridding for axisymmetric capsules with curvature-based discretization
* Generic optimization frameworks with various applications
* General-purpose numerics subroutines and character-manipulation subroutines

A detailed summary of each library/application is provided below.

## Build and Install
The CFDTOOLS software archive is available for download on NASA's public
[Github](https://www.github.com/nasa/cfdtools). The software may be cloned
using `git` in the typical fashion:

    git clone https://www.github.com/nasa/cfdtools.git

Once downloaded, the software is compiled and installed using CMake. The
software has no dependencies, and is known to build successfully using
relatively recent compilers from Intel and GNU on Ubuntu and SUSE Linux. The
basic installation process is as follows:

    cd <cfdtools_source_dir>
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<cfdtools_install_dir> ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install .

Upon installation, all that is required to use the CFDTOOLS applications is to
add `<cfdtools_install_dir>/bin` to the PATH environment variable. If you are
building software that links against the CFDTOOLS library using CMake, simply
add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<cfdtools_install_dir>` to the initial CMake
configuration command for your project. Then, in your projects `CMakeLists.txt`,
add the following:

    find_package(cfdtools REQUIRED)

    add_executable(my_program ...)
    target_link_libraries(my_program cfdtools::<libname>)

CFDTOOLS also supports direct inclusion as a project submodules using CMake's
``add_subdirectory`` command.

* **Jun 30 2014**: Someone needed the DECONSTRUCT utility.  A few updates since
                   Feb 10 include solid angle utilities in ugridlib, a handful of
                   functions in special_functions, and a reworked form of the
                   HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT application that defines lines of sight
                   at a point on a convex body via a triangulated quadrant of a
                   hemisphere rather than via latitude/longitude discretization.
* **Jul 03 2014**: TRI_TO_TRI has been added; a triangulation_io glitch has been
                   corrected.
* **Aug 07 2014**: EXTRACT_BLAYER_DATA has been added to the BLAYER folder.
* **Aug 14 2014**: Optimal_Interpolation now contains the package for treating
                   unstructured data as modified at NASA Ames from Alexander
                   Barth's original, following NASA approval of its added
                   BSD 2-Clause License.
* **Sep 05 2014**: FILTER_LINES and MERGE_TABLES have been added.
* **Sep 24 2014**: Traj_Fit has been added.  It curve-fits heat flux or pressure
                   pulse data using f(rho(t),V(t)) = C rho(t)**m V(t)**n within
                   the QNMDRIVER2 framework, as might be needed for TPS sizing
                   at an entry vehicle body point from selected CFD data points.
* **Oct 03 2014**: The table_io module used by Traj_Fit has been updated.
* **Oct 22 2014**: The triangulation_io package has been extended with options
                   for calculation of area, volume, CM, and moments of inertia.
                   See the new TRIANGULATION_TOOL for driving these options
                   along with shift/scale/rotate options.
* **Nov 17 2014**: Unstructured volume analogues of unstructured surface
                   utilities have been added to triangulation_io and are
                   driven by TRIANGULATION_TOOL.
* **Mar 18 2015**: An apparently inconsequential glitch in BLAYER has been
                   remedied.  This version can also read [unformatted] volume
                   datasets to speed processing of large-grid cases.
* **Mar 13 2015**: OUTBOUND now has an option to applied a CONSTANT margin
                   as a way of moving the forebody boundary a little while
                   barely affecting the wake boundary.
* **Apr 15 2015**: The ADT rapid search package (/adt) now has 2-space multi-
                   block curve analogues of the 3-space structured multiblock
                   surface grid utilities.  LINES_OF_SIGHT_2D uses these to
                   deal with reflected axisymmetric 2-space volume grid.
                   SURFACE_INTERP_2D has been added, using the same 2-space
                   ADT utilities.
* **Aug 23 2016**: TET_INTERP has been added to interpolate tetrahedral volume
                   data to a structured multiblock grid.
* **Mar 17 2017**: SORT_ROWS (added Feb 14) has been extended to allow more
                   than one numeric string in a text column, and to allow
                   output in descending order if desired.
                   Other recent refinements: COLUMNEDIT now allows extraction
                   of more than one column at a time; the table_io module has
                   an updated table_io_read_alpha utility prompted by SORT_ROWS
                   that handles the case of all lines/rows treated as text and
                   having the same number of columns (with no header records
                   assumed).  Previously, all rows were interpreted as header
                   records, meaning the table appeared empty.
* **Jun 23 2017**: NEQAIR_DATA, NEQAIR_Integration, and PREPARE_NEQAIR_DATA
                   have been added to assist radiation calculations with
                   NEQAIR.  NEQAIR itself should be obtained through the
                   Commercial Technology Office at NASA Ames Research Center.
* **Jan 04 2018**: Added A2B utility.  Since June, minor changes have been
                   made to GU, BLAYER, LINES_OF_SIGHT, SHOCK_STAND_OFF, and
                   OUTBOUND.
* **Jun 06 2018**: Added Aero_Coefs application (supplement to DPLR's Postflow).
                   Since January, updates have been made to geomlib, gridlib,
                   progtools, searchlib, CAPSULE_GRID, CONVERTQ, GU, HEMISPHERES_-
                   OF_SIGHT, NEQAIR_Integration, RADIAL_INTERP, and RESHAPE3D.
* **Sep 19 2018**: Added EXTRACT_BLOCKS_2D and EXTRACT_FUNCTIONS; xyq_io and f_io
                   were missing from the xyzq_io folder; since June, several
                   triangulation utilities have been extended to overcome any
                   single-zone assumptions, NEQAIR_Integration has been improved,
                   and POLAR_INTERP has had an option added to generate spoked
                   body points (but see also CAPSULE_SPOKES, which had been over-
                   looked here as well).
* **Nov 07 2018**: Added SLOS (structured grid form of USLOS for lines of sight).
* **Mar 07 2021**: Release updated CMake build system. Move repository to NASA's
                   public [GitHub](https://www.github.com/nasa/cfdtools). Various
                   small improvements to `radial_interp`, `refine`, `capsule_grid`,
                   and `prepare_neqair_data`.
* **Nov 20 2021**: Re-reviewed and approved for open source release by Ames Research
                   center under the NASA Open Source License v1.3. Added updated
                   license file and contributor license agreements.
