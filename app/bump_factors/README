BUMP_FACTORS was prompted by an urgent request at 7:30 am PST on July 31,
following the July 26 Return to Flight launch of Space Shuttle Discovery,
STS-114.  Some damage to a thermal blanket warranted closer CFD analysis.
(The initial SURFACE_INTERP program was also written that same Sunday.)

From the program BUMP_FACTORS header:

Map each point of a damaged surface flow solution to the smooth surface,
and convert the damaged flow quantities to ratios of damaged to undamaged
values by locating the smooth interpolated point nearest to each damaged
point.

Sample control file (standard input):

   BUMP_FACTORS control file
   3      ! Function in damage data to be converted to bump factor
   3      ! Function in smooth data to divide by
   0      ! 1 = flip y of damage data
   1.0000 ! Scale applied to damage function
          ! Damage file first, smooth file 2nd, output 3rd

   case6-rtf_221_surface.dat
   140-02_CASE6_surface-008_BF.dat  ! Use *.plt to get binary output
