INTERP_COLUMNS Description:

PURPOSE:

   Interpolate all columns of a dataset at a specified abscissa or set
   of uniform abscissas (or arbitrary abscissas from an auxiliary file).
   The column to treat as "x" is prompted for, and should be monotonically
   increasing or decreasing.

   Monotonic local cubic splines are used for the interpolations.
   List-directed output to a buffer deals with problems involving output
   record length and the number of significant digits.

HISTORY:

   10/03/01  DAS  Earlier REGULARIZE program (first column = "x" = Time).
   06/12/07   "   Adaptation for something other than a time history.
   06/20/07   "   Added the option to read abscissas from a file.
   04/29/11   "   Formats changed from e15.6 to e16.8 (FIAT_Opt).
   07/08/13   "   Dinesh Prabhu needed to interpolate BLAYER output (68
                  columns): raised the buffer length from 500 to 2048.
