Usage:

      grided

Description:
The grided program is a menu driven program to perform many operations on one or more PLOT3D grid files. Menu options for single grid include:

 Operations that do not change the grid dimensions
 -------------------------------------------------
 1 = Exit from this menu and program
 2 = Interchange J and K grid families
 3 = Interchange K and L grid families
 4 = Interchange J and L grid families
 5 = Reverse index direction in J and/or K and/or L
 6 = Scale followed by translate
 7 = Mirror about x=0, y=0 or z=0 plane
 8 = Rotate about x, y, z or any arbitrary axis
 9 = Reset axis/periodic/C-cut/constant-plane boundary points
10 = Average two or more grids

 Operations that change the grid dimensions
 ------------------------------------------
 11 = Extract a subset
 12 = Add extra planes in J, K or L by extrapolation
      (direction = x/y/z/tangent/smoothed tangent/specified vector)
 13 = Add extra planes in J or K by reflected symmetry
 14 = Add extra planes to 2D grid to form 3D grid for
      '2D' or 'axisymmetric' option in OVERFLOW 
 15 = Duplicate and mirror reflected symmetry grid to form periodic grid in K
 16 = Rotate curve/surface grid to generate surface/volume of revolution
 18 = Create centroid curve along J, K or L direction
 19 = Insert grid plane between 2 slices in J, K or L at specified arc
      length location
 20 = Concatenate another grid to current grid
 21 = Split a grid into 2 grids in J, K, or L direction
 22 = Create a new grid by duplicating a grid - 
      further ops will be performed on duplicated grid
 23 = Split a curve into 2 or more segments at specified x/y/z station
 24 = Split a curve into 2 pieces at location closest to specified x,y,z point
 25 = Remove consecutive coincident points in J/K/L
 26 = Sweep curve/surface grid by rotation and translation to generate surface/volume grid
 99 = Go to multiple grid menu

Menu options for multiple grids include:

  0 = Exit from this menu and program
  1 = Go to single grid menu
  2 = Append grids by reading new grid file
  3 = Remove grids from current list
  4 = Substitute a grid by reading new single grid
  5 = Add/remove iblanks for all grids
  6 = Swap grid numbers of two grids
  7 = Rearrange sequence of all grids
  9 = Write selected grids to file
 11 = Extract grid slices within given tolerance to a Cartesian cut plane
 12 = Extract N levels of grids using multi-grid algorithm
 13 = Auto split curve grids at any interior point if it matches
      any point from another curve grid
 14 = Auto split curve grids at any interior point where the local
      turning angle exceeds a given value
 21 = Check volume mesh local self intersection against L=1 surface
 22 = Report bounding box in the other directions given minmax in x, y or z
