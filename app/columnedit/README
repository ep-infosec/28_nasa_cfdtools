COLUMNEDIT is a simple tool for those not conversant with awk, perl, etc.

Description:

   COLUMNEDIT provides for replacing one column of a text file with any
   column from another text file, or for inserting a new column, deleting
   a column, or extracting a column.  Here, "column" is used in the sense
   of tokens delimited by white space (blanks or tabs).

Limitations:

   > Original column spacing may be lost - recover it with an editor.

History:

   12/11/96  D.Saunders  Initial implementation to facilitate entering
                         nonzero design variable values in the control
                         file of a wing/body design code.
   06/13/00      "       How come no "extract column" option?  (Added it.)
   08/24/00      "       Gnuplot files can exceed 132 characters/line.
   12/28/10      "       Free-format version; considered allowing more than
                         one operation to a file in one run, but it's not
                         worth the trouble (which would include storing the
                         entire file as a 2-D array of tokens).
