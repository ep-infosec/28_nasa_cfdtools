Note to BLAYER users:

Ancillary program EXTRACT_BLAYER_DATA has been added to the BLAYER
folder.  It automates tabulating selected variables from a list of
BLAYER outputs for one body point at a time.

Sample control file (and the trailing comments can stay):

1 1                           ! (iblock, i) for a 2-D case
5 26 6 58 32 7 27 28          ! pw, qconv, Tw, CH, Hedge, Hw, tauwx, tauwy
MHL-t52.0/Baldwin-Lomax/blayer.Re-theta.dat ! Any number of BLAYER outputs

BLAYER implements a curvature-based method of determining boundary layer
edges.  This method is consistent with more standard 99.5% approaches if
the total enthalpy profile has no anomalies, and more likely to produce
a plausible result if it does.  No method is foolproof, however, so odd
results should be looked into and may be worked around with different
control inputs.

BLAYER is employed at NASA ARC in conjunction with the DPLR flow solver
and at NASA LaRC in conjunction with the LAURA flow solver.

The following description has been adapted from the header of program
BLAYER.  Please see blayer.f90 for many more details.

Introduction:

   BLAYER reads a volume dataset from a 2-D or 3-D multiblock real gas flow
solution and derives a one-layer set of results, some of which apply to the
wall, some to the edge of the boundary layer, and (optionally) some to the
roughness height or (if that height is entered as -1. or -2.) to the momentum
thickness height.

   BLAYER is a generalization of BLAYER_RESULTS without the handling of TPS
tile data.  It has been adapted from BLAYER2D and BLAYER3D, which were first
adapted from BLAYER_RESULTS.  A variable number of species is handled, along
with (possibly) more than one temperature and additional flow quantities
beyond those that are required as inputs.

   This version reads Tecplot files (ASCII only), or PLOT3D grid and function
files (ASCII or binary), and writes Tecplot ASCII or binary files.  The
merger of BLAYER2D and -3D was prompted by an upgrade of the Tecplot_io
package to handle Tecplot 360 auxiliary data records.

Assumptions:

   >  The surface is normally expected to be at k = 1 for all grid blocks,
      or j = 1 for the 2-D case.  [Internally, 2-D arrays are treated as if
      they are dimensioned (1:ni, 1, 1:nk).]  However, for each block, the
      program does look for the face or edge with the smallest average
      initial increment off it, and if necessary permutes the block to put
      the wall at the k = 1 position.
      [Overriding the automated wall detection is also possible - see below.]
      If necessary, blocks can be suppressed via the optional blayer.inp.2
      file.

   >  The radial lines are sufficiently normal to the surface for the 1-D
      boundary layer edge detection method to make sense.

   >  The flow quantities are given at the grid-points, not cell centers.

   >  Lee-side results will not be used:  any boundary layer edge detection
      method used is likely to be inappropriate for separated flows.

   LEE-SIDE NOTE:  In spite of the disclaimer about detecting the edge in
                   wake regions, an option has been provided to save the
                   calculated edge locations (and thicknesses) as a second
                   surface dataset to help visualize results with dubiously
                   large edge thicknesses.  See dual use of the output
                   datapacking control below to activate this option.

PLOT3D Input Format (ASCII or Binary):

      File pairs xxx.g/xxx.f or (preferably) xxx.gu/xxx.fu are implied if the
      control file contains (in place of a Tecplot xxx.dat input volume file)
      a file named xxx.g or xxx.gu.

      For DPLR users, the POSTFLOW file should use output format 3 and

         ivarp =  0 100 110 120     1000 150 151 [152] 132 154 50    [extras]

      for single-temperature and two-termperature solutions, respectively,
      analogous to the Tecplot format.
