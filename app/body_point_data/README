   program body_point_data
!
!  Description:
!
!     This utility is intended to ease the pain of gathering time histories for
!     body points from aerothermal solution surface datasets.  One body point is
!     treated at a time using a control file that should be straightforward to
!     prepare.  The intended input files are surface datasets from DPLR's
!     POSTFLOW utility, or outputs from BLAYER, and (optionally) outputs
!     gathered from a sequence of NEQAIR runs.
!
!  Control file format (read on standard input):

!
!  Assumptions:
!
!     o  Control file comments should begin with '!'.
!        This may be changed to another character in one place if necessary.
!
!     o  The input file of times that will become column 1 in the output table
!        should contain one time per line.  The number of times found should
!        match the length of each list of datasets to be searched for the
!        indicated body point.
!
!     o  Input dataset file names may be symbolic links or full paths.
! 
!     o  For the indicated body point coordinates, the nearest data point is
!        chosen from each dataset.  Exact coordinates are not required, and no
!        interpolation is attempted.  The coordinates are assumed to be common
!        to each set of like files.
!
!     o  Any of the laminar, turbulent, and radiative file lists may be
!        omitted in the control file (F instead of T), but the header in the
!        control file should not be omitted.  (LATER:) Allowing the laminar
!        input group to be suppressed is more trouble than it's worth, so
!        Laminar = T is assumed but retained for aesthetic reasons.
!
!     o  If laminar and turbulent are both specified, only qw is extracted from
!        the turbulent datasets, and it is appended to the laminar variables.
!
!     o  If radiative datasets are present, qrad is assumed to be in the last
!        input column (no need for column headers) and it will form the last
!        output column.

!  History:
!
!     05/13/2021  D.A.Saunders  Initial design.  This is overdue, and should be
!                               straightforward to implement using existing
!                               Tecplot I/O utilities and the relatively recent
!                               table_io module.
!     05/18/2021   "   "   "    Extracting the time column from the file names
!                               as in the initial design proved more trouble
!                               than it was worth, so read the times from a
!                               file.  One time per line simplifies work-space
!                               allocation.
!     05/20/2021   "   "   "    Initial coding is complete (on a laptop), but
!                               our only computer is down for maintenance.
!                               This has proved to be a lot messier than one
!                               might imagine, so testing is expected to take
!                               considerable effort.
!     05/24/2021   "   "   "    Debugged the compilation.  Testing has to wait.
!     05/26/2021   "   "   "    Testing proved arduous--mostly due to confusion
!                               associated with the various lists of variable
!                               names.  The 80-character filename limit in
!                               tecplot_io.f90 had to be raised (to 160 chars.).
!     05/26/2021   "   "   "    Fixed run-time formatting glitch.  The debug
!                               output is helpful as a dialogue, so leave it in
!                               there for now.  It would be nice to right-
!                               justify the column header tokens, based on the
!                               run-time format string.
