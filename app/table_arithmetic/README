program table_arithmetic

Description:
   This aid to Excel novices is intended to ease the burden of compiling
   tables of results from multiple related analyses.  It was prompted by
   the need to adjust units (e.g., convert W/m^2 to W/cm^2) (scale and/or
   shift operations) and to form ratios of radiative to convective heat
   flux at a given body point on an atmospheric entry vehicle (implying
   input of a second table and operations on matching columns).
   (Later:) Now we can add or divide pairs of columns from table 1 also.

   Some options involve only one table, and multiple operations can be
   performed on any of the columns in one run.  Output number formats
   can be specified at run time (e.g., an input E format may be preferred
   as an output F format, for preparing a slide).  Reals desired to be
   treated as integers are handled with a format such as i3 for column
   1 in the example below.

   Any second table, at least initially, is expected to match the first
   in terms of row counts (cf. matrix multiplication, which requires
   certain dimensions to match).

   See also the author's much earlier COLUMNEDIT for extracting, inserting,
   or replacing table columns.  The TABLE_IO module and the RDLIST subroutine
   are key building blocks, without which contemplating this type of utility
   would probably be foolhardy.  (RDLIST allows entry of column lists, say,
   via any reasonable shorthand, such as 2:8 for the sample table below.)

   Table 1 can also be thinned as rows 1, 1+n, 1+2n, ... now.

Table Inputs:
   Any initial lines that are not purely numeric are treated as header
   information by the table_io package, and ignored.  Any header records
   from table 1 are transferred to the output table.  An example of a
   radiative heat flux table follows:

       t,s  BP 1   BP 2   BP 3   BP 4   BP 5   BP 6   BP 7
       50 0.2887 0.1785 0.1341 0.1383 0.1005 0.1362 0.1946

       95 4.6270 2.8072 1.9010 1.4455 1.2590 1.6965 3.5093
      104 3.6444 2.2715 1.8328 1.5137 1.3239 1.5524 3.8476
      112 1.3757 0.8778 0.7848 0.6097 0.5070 0.5730 3.4849
      121 0.3423 0.2136 0.1826 0.1289 0.0978 0.1198 1.4563
      130 0.0918 0.0500 0.0600 0.0600 0.0492 0.0600 0.3987

    All rows of specified columns (except headers) are operated on.

    If a menu is added to, be sure to adjust the appropriate prompt for a
    menu choice, where ^D and maxmenu* are both indicated.

History:
   11/17/2018  D.A.Saunders  Initial design.
   11/19/2018    "      "    Initial coding and testing completed.
   11/20/2018    "      "    Displaying a table on the screen required a
                             a change in table_io.f90, which now has a
                             table_io_copy option that allows starting
                             over with either table.  Also, table 2 may
                             now be scaled or shifted.
   08/15/2018    "      "    The requirement that a second table needs the
                             same number of columns as the first was more
                             restrictive than it needed to be.

                             table 1 columns and also for thinning table 1
