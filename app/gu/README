GU Description:

   Grid utility to manipulate multiblock PLOT3D grids or function files,
   in one of many ways per run.

History:

   05/01/13  Ryan McDaniel   Original release (mostly FORTRAN 77).
   May 2013  David Saunders  Fortran 90 version.  Swap x/y/z option added.
   09/09/13    "      "      Ryan found mirrored block handedness was
                             forgotten.  Also: the header record of
                             unformatted blocks extracted as a chunk was
                             wrong (not one record).
Menu:
