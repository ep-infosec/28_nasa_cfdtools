DISTRIBUTE Description:

PURPOSE:

   DISTRIBUTE is a driving program for the available 1-D grid point
distribution utilities.  It allows generation of one or more distri-
butions on the specified interval(s) [a, b].  Results may be saved
in one or both of two ways: one for plotting via QPLOT, and one that
is more convenient for use by programs such as SMOOTH or PROFILE or
some other grid generator.

METHOD:

   The indicated output file(s) are opened, then an indefinite loop
is entered over the desired cases, which are selected one at a time
from a menu.  Some selections may require additional interactive
inputs.  The interval [a, b] may be changed for each case.  Defaults
are [0, 1] initially, and the previous interval subsequently.

   All distributions generated in one run of DISTRIBUTE will appear on
the same plot frame (if plotting is requested).  Unconnected symbols are
the normal choice of line type, though the symbols may be suppressed.
The plot legend is used (with internal writes in some cases) to make
each plotted distribution as self-descriptive as possible.  Other plot
parameters such as max/min values are defaulted - QPLOT handles them.

NOTES:

o  QPLOT is a general purpose plotting package developed by Robert
   Kennelly and David Saunders (Sterling/Aerodynamics Division, NASA
   Ames).  Regrettably, its underlying graphics package, CA-DISSPLA,
   is not supported for Linux, and needs a license anyway.
   Adaptation to some other line-plotting package should be doable
   if someone has the time to do it.
