RECTIFY_GRID Description:

   RECTIFY_GRID scans a grid for blocks that are not right-handed, and
swaps their (i,j) ordering for x, y, and z.  An optional "q" file (or
rather a PLOT3D-type function file) may be similarly reordered.

   For the surface case, the user needs to indicate which patches are to
be rectified via any meaningful integer list entered at the keyboard on a
single line.

   E.g.:  1 3:6 11-13

   In this case, if an empty line is entered, the program will write a
function file containing components of the unit normals to each point.
Typically, contour plotting of one of these components should suffice to
tell whether the patch is right-handed (normal pointing out) or not.
Omitting any function file if normals are to be calculated is sensible.
Then, if necessary, the program can be rerun and the appropriate patches
to rectify can be entered interactively.

Control file ('rectify_grid.inp'):

   RECTIFY_GRID control file

   T            Formatted?
   none         Accompanying function file, or 'none'
   T
   rectified.g  Rectified grid
   T            Formatted?
   none         Rectified function file
