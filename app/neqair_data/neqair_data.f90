   program neqair_data
!
!  Version Description:
!
!     This version of NEQAIR_DATA can write line-of-sight (LOS) data in both the
!  original rigid format read by NEQAIR versions up to and including v14 and the
!  simpler column-oriented format handled from NEQAIR v15 on.  Both data formats
!  involve a sample.LOS.dat file read here that indicates the species names.  If
!  a sample file is found with a NEQAIR version number on line 1, then the later
!  data format is indicated. The sample file is transcribed as the header of all
!  output LOS data files in either case.
!
!  Original Preamble:
!
!     Earlier utilities LINES_OF_SIGHT[_2D] and FLOW_INTERP[_2D] typically
!  produce multiple lines of sight and flow-field data interpolated to each
!  point of each line of sight, as a PLOT3D-type multiblock grid and function
!  file pair.  Note that the input coordinates should correspond to grid
!  vertices, not cell centers, because the lines of sight are discretized using
!  the relative distribution of the nearest radial line from the vertex-
!  centered grid.
!
!     Radiation program NEQAIR treats one line of sight at a time, and expects
!  the data in a rigid format containing arc lengths (measured in the direction
!  towards the body, and in cm), total number density, T, Tr, Tv, Te, and the
!  species number densities, at each grid point along the line.  The arc lengths
!  should correspond to the centers of cells at which the flow function data
!  are taken to apply (in NEQAIR), so they are adjusted accordingly here.  The
!  wall function values thus apply to a cell half the width of the grid cell
!  at the wall.
!
!     [Later:  This version has the option, prompted by meteor studies, to
!  output line-of-sight data in the direction away from the body.]
!
!     This program retrieves the PLOT3D-format files (e.g., los.g & los.f in
!  SI units) and writes a separate file in NEQAIR's LOS.dat format for each
!  line of sight it finds, into the working directory. These output file names
!  contain line numbers, such as LOS-1.dat.  A script can then run NEQAIR on
!  some range m:n of line numbers, by copying or linking to input files and
!  writing radiation results for each line one level down in directories
!  /LINE-m through /LINE-n (say).
!
!     The current version now offers options to redistribute the line-of-sight
!  data to a [presumably smaller] different number of points in order to speed
!  the expensive NEQAIR calculations.  This was initially done based on |dT/ds|,
!  where T is vibrational temperature and s is arc length along the line.  (Use
!  of the translational temperature, which is higher than Tv at the shock, tends
!  to produce spacing that is too coarse in the boundary layer.)  See below for
!  further redistribution options.
!
!  Method:
!
!     The grid and function file may be 2D or 3D (automatically determined).
!  The input grid coordinates are assumed to be in meters, emanating from the
!  body towards the shock.  Normal usage with the DPLR flow solver has block
!  dimensions (1,nj) or (1,1,nk), but these can safely be treated here as (nj,1)
!  or (nk,1,1) for more efficient Fortran indexing.  Points outside the shock
!  need to be suppressed to avoid NEQAIR trouble with low temperatures, and the
!  line data need to be output in the shock-to-body direction.
!
!               The following paragraph is NEQAIR V14-specific:
!
!     The function file should contain T, Tr, Tv, Te (K) and the species number
!  densities (m^-3).  Note that DPLR's postprocessor does NOT extract Tr unless
!  irot = 1.  BE SURE THAT THERE ARE 4 TEMPERATURES IN THE FUNCTION FILE.
!  Common usage with 2-temperature data (ivib = 1 in DPLR) means reading and
!  writing T, T, Tv, Tv for these 4 temperatures.
!
!               NEQAIR V15 differences:
!
!     NEQAIR V15[+] handles variables numbers of temperatures.  The number of
!  species names beginning with T determines the number of temperatures that
!  should be in the input function file in the indicated order.
!
!     One line of sight's worth of data (one input block) is read at a time.
!  The header of a file named sample.LOS.dat file in the working directory is
!  transcribed to each output file, down to the line above the first line of
!  the data proper for line 1.  This sample file should contain the species
!  names in the order matching the input function file.  This program is thus
!  independent of the number and order of the species, as long as the file
!  sample.LOS.dat lists them in the header in the correct order.
!
!  Minimum Contents of File sample.LOS.dat:
!
!     V14 or earlier:
!
!        >  A line of asterisks precedes the species section.
!        >  The species names may appear in any order.
!        >  Two lines of hyphens must appear.  The last line is all hyphens.
!        >  Replace the comments in column 1 below appropriately.

!           total number density, cm^-3, which is determined and written here
!           and is NOT expected in the input function file).
!
!  Point Redistribution Options:
!
!     If the option to reduce the number of points along each line of sight is
!  employed, this is done based on the magnitude of the distribution of the
!  gradient of Tv (3rd flow function) with respect to arc length.  All of the
!  function data profiles are interpolated nonlinearly to the redistributed
!  grid points here, as opposed to requiring the FLOW_INTERP[_2D] step to be
!  repeated before rerunning NEQAIR_DATA on redistributed line-of-sight data.
!  The typical function units are so large that these interpolations are
!  performed in normalized space.
!
!     It appears that 3/4ths of the input number of points per line may be the
!  best compromise, since halving the number tends to lose too much resolution
!  in the boundary layer of typical forebody lines.  For a similar reason, it
!  appears that the maximum effect of temperature gradient should be invoked
!  by using a power of 1.0 for the temperature-gradient-based shape function,
!  where lower power moderates the effect and power = 0. would give uniform
!  spacing at the other extreme (definitely NOT recommended).  Up to 2.0 is
!  permitted, but don't go that high without scrutinizing the consequences.
!
!     Extreme cases (high pressures/thin boundary layers) may not be able to
!  converge with high exponents anyway.  This can mean too much thinning in
!  the boundary layer, so a hybrid scheme is now an option: the shock region
!  (defined by the range from the outer boundary to the largest input spacing)
!  is redistributed by the gradient-base method to the SAME number of shock-
!  region points, and the rest of each profile employs a 2-sided Vinkour
!  distribution to obtain the specified total number of points, with the new
!  wall spacing determined by the ratio of the input to the output number of
!  points and a heuristic multiplier.  This preserves the character of the
!  boundary layer point distribution, where gradient-based everywhere may not.
!
!     Following the hybrid option, a curvature-based option has also been added.
!  This works with a normalized form of the Tv vs. LOS arc curve.  For the
!  extreme cases of high pressure, this method tends to improve the boundary
!  layer point distribution, but it does the same sort of thing in the shock
!  region and therefore tends to put too many points there.  Therefore, it
!  has now been changed to leave a heuristic fraction of the grid points
!  untouched in the shock region (0.2 currently), giving better resolution
!  of the boundary-layer-edge region, which appears to be where radiance
!  losses in NEQAIR occur compared with simple 2x thinning of the CFD points.
!  That thinning option is now (belatedly) a redistribution option as well.
!
!     Most of the above discussion applies to forebody lines of sight (only).
!  The hybrid and curvature-based methods both assume a shock is present, so do
!  NOT use either of them on lines in the wake where no shock is encountered.
!
!  History:
!
!     11/13/13  D.A.Saunders  Initial rewrite of a program by Aaron Brandis
!                             that expected LOS data in Tecplot format rather
!                             than PLOT3D multiblock format.
!     11/14/13    "     "     Low temperature data outside the shock cause
!                             trouble in NEQAIR.  Dinesh Prabhu recommends
!                             suppressing points with Tv < 500 K.
!     11/15/13    "     "     Guard against extremely low number densities,
!                             which can affect NEQAIR performance.
!     11/21/13    "     "     The arc length outputs now correspond to the
!                             centers of the cells at which the function data
!                             are taken to apply within NEQAIR.
!     11/23/13    "     "     An option has been provided to redistribute the
!                             line-of-sight coordinates based on |dTv/ds| and
!                             interpolate all the temperature and species
!                             profiles nonlinearly before writing the lines in
!                             NEQAIR format.
!     12/03/13    "     "     GRADDIS[3D]2 now return updated arc lengths
!                             because recovering them from the new x,y[,z]s
!                             is not identical to using the arcs that produced
!                             those new coordinates.

!                             likely choice for lines in the wake, where the
!                             hybrid scheme is definitely NOT recommended.

!                             the input data points in the shock region and
!                             confine the curvature-based method to the rest
!                             of the profile.  Lack of explicit blending of
