   program polar_interp
!
!  Description:
!
!     From surface data representing "spokes" of a symmetric body ordered by
!     azimuthal angle, interpolate a single-patch surface grid (and optional
!     function data) with specified dimensions.  The method can apply to a body
!     with off-center nose as well.  The interpolated grid has uniform spacing
!     (at least in the initial implementation).
!
!     The intent is to pad coarse input data via nonlinear interpolation in the
!     two surface directions using a 1-D spline method, by taking advantage of
!     the spoke structure, so that methods appropriate for high-resolution data
!     can then be applied.  The initial application is to (expensive) radiation
!     calculations on a coarse polar grid that need to be interpolated to a
!     dense CFD mesh.  Direct use of SURFACE_INTERP produces faceting because
!     the data cells are so big and the method is a one-cell method.
!
!     The azimuthal interpolations are performed versus clock angle, and the
!     angles of the data spokes are deduced from the given (x,y,z) coordinates.
!
!     Originally, only half the body was treated but this version has the option
!     to treat a full body. In the full body case, the first spoke is replicated
!     automatically, and periodic interpolations are employed in the azimuthal
!     direction.  In the half body case, the second and second-last spokes are
!     reflected automatically so that the interpolations match what would be
!     obtained if the missing half body were present (by reflection) explicitly.
!     If the first and/or last spokes do not appear to be on the center line,
!     the dataset is still interpolated to a structured surface mesh with no
!     symmetry assumptions.
!
!     A few prompts control the run (or a short control file on standard input).
!
!     This version provides for replicating the center point as makes sense for
!     expensive radiative heating data: one spoke may be indicated as containing
!     the center location as its first point; unless 0 is entered to suppress
!     this option, each other spoke then has that point inserted by this program
!     as its new first point.  Standard input entries:
!
!        xxx.dat             ! Input dataset name
!        ni nj               ! Output surface grid dimensions
!        yyy.dat             ! Output Tecplot ASCII dataset
!        1                   ! Spoke containing center point, or 0
!
!  Coordinate System:
!
!     Ox is assumed to be parallel to the symmetry axis, and right handedness
!     is assumed.  Oz is "up".
!
!  Input Data Format:
!
!     For historical reasons (NEQAIR practices), the input format is PLOT3D-like
!     (header records at the top), but in "point" rather than "block" order,
!     with at least one spoke beginning with the center point that is assumed
!     to be common to all spokes (see above option to replicate this point).
!     The first spoke should be at the 12 o'clock position (with the nose point
!     first).  The following spokes may proceed either clockwise or anticlock-
!     wise.
!
!     11 3                 [Number of spokes and number of functions per spoke]
!     15                   [Number of points on spoke 1]
!     15                   [  "   "   "   "   "   "   2]
!     :
!     :
!     9                    [  "   "   "   "   "   "  11]
!     x y z f1 f2 f3       [Coordinates and functions for point 1 of spoke 1]
!     x y z f1 f2 f3
!     : : : : : : :
!     : : : : : : :
!     x y z f1 f2 f3       [  "   "   "   "   "   "   "   "   " 9  "   "  11]
!
!  Output Data Format:
!
!     Single-zone Tecplot ASCII dataset, BLOCK order, suited to SURFACE_INTERP
!     for likely interpolation to a CFD grid to go with output from BLAYER for
!     CBAERO anchoring purposes.
!
!  Option (1) To Help Generate Target Spokes:
!
!     Constructing spokes on an "ellipsled" slender-body vehicle prompted this
!     option to read surface grid patch indices in the spoked form above, with
!     x and y replaced by i and j, and no z or function data.  The output is
!     then in the above spoked form (x, y, z only) as needed to define body
!     points for radiative heating calculations.  No interpolations are done.
!
!     Alternative Input Data Format (to help prepare the normal input data):
!
!        13  ! # spokes
!        18  ! # points on spoke 1:nspokes
!        17
!        17
!        :
!        :
!        8
!        1  1 ! (i,j) defining apex point 1 of spoke 1
!        8  1
!        16 1
!        :  :
!        :  :
!        8  3
!        16 3
!        :  :
!        :  :
!        8  65
!        17 65
!        :  :
!        :  :
!        137 65
!
!     If the first token on every line of the dataset prompted for initially
!     is an integer (no decimal point), this retrofitted option is assumed,
!     and a new prompt for the single-patch surface grid to which the indices
!     refer is issued so that indices can be converted to (x,y,z) coordinates.
!     This surface grid should be in PLOT3D form, ASCII or unformatted.
!
!  Option (2) To Help Generate Target Spokes:
!
!     For the axisymmetric case, this option expects a form of the generatrix
!     as the input dataset entered as the first control input. This should be
!     suited to NEQAIR calculations: fairly coarse towards the shoulder where
!     tangent-slab results are less appropriate and where use of option (1)
!     above via every nth CFD-type surface grid point in the spoke direction
!     puts too many points. The input ni and nj for the second prompt should
!     be the number of points in this generatrix-type dataset (the "12'oclock"
!     spoke, including the center point) and the number of spokes produced from
!     this input spoke and nj - 1 evenly-spaced rotations of it about the nose
!     point in the anticlockwise direction.  (The repeated nose point from the
!     rotated spokes is suppressed in the output dataset, the name of which is
!     prompted for. As with Option (1) above, this dataset matches the normal
!     input form with header indices but without any function data.)
!
!     The input dataset in this case looks like this:
!
!     x  y  ! Nose coordinates
!     x  y  ! Further points along the generatrix at the 12 o'clock position
!     x  y  ! y is likely to be 0. on all lines
!     x  y
!     :  :
!     x  y
!
!     Option (2) is detected by the decimal point(s) expected on line 1, so
!     don't enter 0  0 (integers) there.
!
!  Separate Means of Generating Spoked Body Points (CAPSULE_SPOKES):
!
!     For the axisymmetric case, the simplest way of generating spoked body
!     points is probably the more recent CAPSULE_SPOKES utility, which reads a
!     list of clock angles at which to rotate an input generatrix from the 12
!     o'clock position to the 6 o'clock position.  The spokes need not be uni-
!     formly spaced, in contrast to those produced by Option (2) above.
!
!  History:
!
!     08/29/08  D. Saunders  Initial implementation as part of an alternative
!                            to giving NEQAIR a (coarse) surface triangulation.
!                            Preserving some structure and padding should allow
!                            fewer coarse surface points than the unstructured
!                            approach to putting points where they're needed.
!
!     10/06/08   "      "    Added the option to replicate the first (center)
!                            point of one spoke as the first point for all other
!                            spokes, as makes sense for radiative heating data.
!
!     05/19/09   "      "    Retrofitted an option to read indices defining the
!                            spoked data points needed to set up body point
!                            coordinates for radiative heating calculations.
!                            A PLOT3D-type surface grid must accompany the input
!                            data file if it apparently contains (i,j) indices
!                            that define the spokes rather than (x,y,z,f) data.
!                            Only a single-patch grid appears necessary, as
!                            produced by HEAT_SHIELD (but with y and z swapped
!                            to be compatible with DPLR).
!
!     06/15/12   "      "    Jeff Brown had wind tunnel data on both halves of
!                            an inflatable decelerator, prompting the option to
!                            handle more than just half-body datasets.  The
!                            spoke order may be clockwise or anticlockwise but
!                            spoke 1 should be at 12 o'clock for half and whole
!                            body cases.  (Parts of bodies may still be OK no
!                            matter where they start, with no symmetry assump-
!                            tions made.)
!
!     06/18/12   "      "    The full-body case can use LCSFIT's cyclic option,
!                            at least for the geometry.
!
!     08/22/18   "      "    Belated addition of a simple second way of generat-
!                            ing target spoke coordinates via rotation of a
!                            generatrix-like spoke 1, for axisymmetric cases.
!
!     05/20/19   "      "    Mysterious early termination with no error message
!                            and no output seems to have been mishandling of
!                            ios in the look_for_generating_spokes procedure.
!
!     05/21/19   "      "    Added mention of the (more recent) CAPSULE_SPOKES
!                            utility as a way of generating spoked body points.
