NBYN, NBYN2, and NBYN3 provide for interactive solution of small square
systems of equations:

NBYN  drives the versions of DECOMP & SOLVE from Forsythe, et al., giving
      the matrix condition number estimate as well as the solution for
      one or more right hand sides.

NBYN2 drives LUSOLVE from the linsys library, suited to a single RHS.

NBYN3 drives the versions of DECOMP & SOLVE from the linsys library (no
      condition number estimate; multiple right hand sides).
