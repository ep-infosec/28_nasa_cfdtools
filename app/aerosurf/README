   AEROSURF is the stand-alone driver of the geometry paneling modules
used by the multiblock design code, SYN107-MB.  It is needed to provide
the initial paneling used with an initial surface grid by program UV to
parameterize that grid for efficient mesh perturbations during the design
process.  It treats geometric entities such as wings, fuselages, pylons,
nacelles, etc., by calculating various intersections and imposing regular
panels on the intersected surfaces representing a complete or partial
aerodynamic configuration.

   Main routine SURFER and the routines it calls should be identical to
the corresponding routines in the design software.

   The geometry definitions are in the form of planar sections, to which
perturbing shape function ("sine bumps") may be added.  Shape optimization
procedures for full aerospace configurations have no doubt progressed
since this work from the 1990s, but the stand-alone portion of it (this
AEROSURF package) may yet find further uses.
