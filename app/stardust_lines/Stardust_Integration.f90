   program Stardust_Integration
!
!  Description:
!
!     Stardust_Integration is a variant of the neqair_integration utility to
!  accompany the Stardust_Lines line-of-sight generation scheme for the step
!  that integrates the radiation solver calculations.  Instead of a triangulated
!  hemisphere defining lines of sight to a spacecraft body point, it works with
!  a rectangular array of pixels defining parallel lines orthogonal to the pixel
!  plane.  The same main options are provided: integration of a single radiance
!  at each pixel (over solid angle subtended at a remote viewing point, giving a
!  heat flux) or (more likely) a comparable integration for each wavelength in
!  the spectral radiance outputs from the solver.  In the case of NEQAIR, these
!  large outputs are intensity.out or intensity_scanned.out. In the simple case,
!  each radiance is read from the last line of neqair.out, or (as a check) from
!  the single-line file named radiance.out written during a preceding spectral
!  integration run of this utility.
!
!  Method:
!
!     o  Read the sensor location relative to the spacecraft position (details
!        TBD).  This relative location was also needed to determine the orienta-
!        tion of the pixel plane that defines the lines of sight processed here.
!     o  Determine from the /LINE-1 subdirectory the kind of outputs from
!        NEQAIR that are to be integrated.  This defines a column number as
!        0, 1, 2, or 3 to be read from.
!     o  Read the pixel array as pixels.g from Stardust_Lines (a PLOT3D surface
!        grid in 3-space).
!     o  Read the header of the line segments output by Stardust_Lines.  Any
!        line with nk = 2 is assigned zero for each output from NEQAIR, which
!        is not invoked for such lines that did not pass through the flow field.
!        The (i,j) corresponding to each meaningful line in /LINE-n for any n
!        can also be determined.
!
!     o  [Simple radiance case:] For each meaningful line, read a single
!        radiance for the indicated pixel, and enter zeros for the other lines.
!        Integrate over the rectangular pixel array w.r.t. solid angle subtended
!        at the remote sensor location.  We are done.
!
!     o  [Spectral case:] Read the wavelengths specified in the NEQAIR control
!        file, neqair.inp.
!     o  Scan the NEQAIR outputs from all meaningful lines and establish a
!        single set of wavelengths that are uniform in each region and as dense
!        as the densest line found in each region.
!     o  Suppress the duplicate wavelengths at the region boundaries that are
!        present in the NEQAIR outputs.
!     o  As many sums as there are uniformly distributed wave-lengths in all
!        the regions are accumulated one line at a time as in the earlier
!        neqair_integration scheme, as follows:
!        o  For each cell in the pixel array, calculate the solid angle domega
!           subtended at the sensor location.
!        o  For each quad. cell vertex, the "weight" corresponding to each
!           vertex of each triangle in the hemisphere case is domega/4 * cosine
!           of the angle between the vertex and the central pixel line to the
!           remote sensor, as needed to isolate the normal component at the
!           sensor.  (Even though these angles will be extremely small, include
!           them anyway.)
!        o  For each pixel, skip it if the line of sight didn't pass through the
!           flow field (nk = 2), else read the spectral radiances associated
!           with the line of sight and interpolate to the regularized wave-
!           lengths.
!        e  Increment the sums for all (regularized) wavelengths by the
!           vertex weight*(regularized) radiances.
!        o  Integrate the regularized radiances w.r.t. wavelength, and write
!           a one-line 'radiances.out' result in that line's subdirectory.
!        o  Save the solid angle integrations for each regularized wavelength
!           as 'integrations.dat'.  This file contains spectral irradiances.
!        o  Integrate these w.r.t. wavelength as a check on the heat-flux case.
!           This result is converted from angstroms to microns to give W/cm^2.
!
!  (Later): Dinesh and Jay believe the spacecraft is effectively a point source,
!           so we should just sum results at all pixels.  These are written as
!           spectral_sums.dat (one sum per regularized wavelength).
!           NO: For such a file to converge with increasing resolution, divide
!           by the number of active pixels, ASSUMING DENSER RESOLUTIONS RETAIN
!           THE SAME RELATIVE SPACING.  This means changing the d1 used for
!           one-sided stretching proportionately.  E.g.: go from  65  0.0005
!           to  129  0.00025 or to  97  0.00033333333333...
!           Call the file spectral_irradiance.dat and double the average to
!           account for a 360-degree flow field, not 180 deg.
!  (Later   This file was never looked at and the name spectral_irradiance.dat
!   still)  is really what integrations.dat should've been named.  Suppress it.

      subroutine analyze_wavelengths ()
!
!     This adaptation of neqair_integration performs its original function for
!     each wavelength of each region analyzed by NEQAIR.  It is isolated to
!     leave the original single-radiance-per-linescheme essentially intact,
!     although that scheme can be reused following analysis of the
!     intensity_scanned.out or intensity.out files by processing the one-line
!     radiance.out files that are written at the end of the more elaborate
!     analysis by integrating w.r.t. wavelength for each line of sight.
!
!     To be more precise, a common set of wavelengths has to be imposed on each
!     line before any integrations.  This is done by scanning all lines for the
!     maximum number of (uniform?) wavelengths in each region and interpolating
!     the spectral radiances to uniform wavelengths that are dense enough not to
!     lose resolution in any region of any line.
!
!     Storing all of the functions (possibly millions of spectral radiances) for
!     all of the lines in order to do the integrations the way they are done in
!     the original scheme would require prohibitive amounts of memory. Instead,
!     one line can be processed at a time and a summation can be performed for
!     each (common) wavelength.  Thanks to Brett Cruden for pointing this out.
!     Consider the 1-D trapezoidal rule analog to see this more easily.

!
!     For each uniform wavelength derived from the wavelengths found in many
!     intensity[_scanned].out files produced by NEQAIR, integrate the spectral
!     radiances w.r.t. solid angle subtended at the indicated sensor location
!     by the underlying rectangular array of quadrilateral pixels cells.
!
!     The straightforward scheme used for single radiance outputs from NEQAIR
!     would require exorbitant amounts of memory to set up all the data ready
!     for integration. Instead, one line is processed at a time and a summation
!     is performed for each (common) wavelength.  Brett Cruden pointed out this
!     more efficient approach.  Consider the 1-D trapezoidal rule analog to
!     understand it more readily.  Outline:
!
!     o  For each cell in the pixel array, calculate the solid angle domega
!        subtended at the sensor location.
!     o  For each cell, the "weight" corresponding to each vertex of the cell
!        is domega/4 * cosine (angle between cell centroid and pixel plane
!        center).
!     o  For each pixel, skip it if the line of sight didn't pass through the
!        flow field (nk = 2), else read the spectral radiances associated
!        with the line of sight and interpolate to the regularized wavelengths.
!     o  Increment the sums for each wavelength by weight*radiance.
!     o  Integrate the regularized radiances w.r.t. wavelength, and write
!        a one-line 'radiances.out' result in that line's subdirectory.
!     o  Save the solid angle integrations for each regularized wavelength
!        as 'integrations.dat'.  These are spectral irradiance files.
!        The values are doubled to account for calculations on a 180-degree
!        revolved axisymmetric flow solution.
!     o  Integrate these w.r.t. wavelength as a check on the heat-flux case.
!        This result is converted from angstroms to microns to give W/cm^2.
