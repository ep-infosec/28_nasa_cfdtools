This directory contains software updated or added for Hayabusa 2.

Stardust_Lines has been improved in several ways, including handling of
nonconvex aft-body surfaces and improved diagnostics.

Stardust_Integration.f90 implements the analysis of NEQAIR calculations that
was done differently by independent investigators for Stardust and Hayabusa 1.

Point_source.f90 was prompted by the Hayabusa 2 observation team's request
that they be provided with spectral radiant intensity files derived from
the spectral irradiance data (integrations.dat) by multiplying by the square
of the slant range.

See also NEQAIR_DATA, which now handles the Stardust case, including as needed
for proper use of NEQAIR's black body BC, which requires overriding high outflow
temperatures at the downstream outflow grid boundary.

For CAPSULE_GRID inputs and results matching the generatrix extracted here from
stardust.grd, see:
