REORDER_SEGMENTS Description:

This is a rather specialized utility prompted by the need to manipulate a
centerline dataset from a full-body flow solution on a CAPSULE_GRID grid.
The dataset is first extracted with POSTFLOW as 8 zones then turned into a
single zone via the XLINE utility, which is used to remove all the " zone"
lines).  Actually, this utility now has the option to remove the "zone"
lines itself.

The problem with merging as a single zone is that the line segments don't
fit end-to-end as needed for plotting as a single curve.  Simple lists of
zone dimensions, reverse-order switches, and output order of the adjusted
segments serve to drive the utility.

The control file name is hard-coded as 'reorder_segments.inp' as opposed
to being read from standard input so that the file to be processed can be
prompted for.  The input file name is prepended with 'reordered.' for the
output file name.

Sample reorder_segments.inp:

   1   ! nheader    = # file header lines to transmit unchanged
   1   ! nzonelines = # zone header lines/zone to suppress in the output
   5   ! ncolumns   = # columns in all remaining lines
   8   ! nzones     = # line segments (zones) to be shuffled
   17 17 90 90 111 111 17 17  ! Input segment lengths
   T  F  F  T  F   T   T  F   ! T = reverse segment order
   2  3  6  7  8   5   4  1   ! Output order of segments
