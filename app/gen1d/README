PURPOSE:

   GEN1D is intended to generate data that can be used for evaluating 1-D
   interpolation/smoothing routines. It provides a menu of likely functions
   of one variable (easily modified as necessary).  It also provides the
   option to evaluate the specified function at a self-generated set of
   grid points or at a set read from a file.  Results are written to
   'gen1d.dat' in the following (Tecplotable) format:

                    # Title with function details
                    # NPTS
                    X(1)     Y(1)
                    X(2)     Y(2)
                     :        :
                    X(NPTS)  Y(NPTS)

   If a grid is read from a file, its format is the same except that it has
   1 column, not 2.  (Columns after the first will be ignored.)

   Provision is made for parametric functions in the form X = X(T),
   Y = Y(T).  Here, reading a T distribution is an unlikely requirement
   and is NOT provided for.

   An option for applying noise to the Y values (or to both X and Y for the
   parametric functions) is also provided.

METHOD:

      Select function of X from menu.
      Prompt for type of grid to use:
      IF <self-generated> THEN
         Prompt for XMIN, XMAX, DX.
         Generate points X(*).
      ELSE
         Prompt for grid file name and read X(*).
      END IF
      Prompt for additional constants and evaluate function at all pts.
      Write them to the output file.
