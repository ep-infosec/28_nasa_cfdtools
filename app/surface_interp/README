SURFACE_INTERP Description:

   Read a structured surface dataset (Tecplot ASCII) and a second target
   dataset of one or more patches (possibly unstructured points in a
   simpler format).  Interpolate the first dataset at each target point
   and save results as a Tecplot file and (for the simpler input format)
   as a tabulation for possible pasting into a spreadsheet.  The output
   file(s) may contain just a subset of the input functions.

Control file format (standard input):

   SURFACE_INTERP control file
   target_points.dat      ! Target file name
   1                      ! Target format: 1 = list of points; 2 = Tecplot
   Subset of functions in output file(s):
   1 4 2
   A_CFD03TS_DPLR_RTFCG_A40_PhyMod1_BL_EE.dat      ! File to be searched
   A_CFD03TS_DPLR_RTFCG_A40_PhyMod1_BL_EE_BP.dat   ! Plottable results
   A_CFD03TS_DPLR_RTFCG_A40_PhyMod1_BL_EE_BP.txt   ! Tabulated results
   2 1 1                  ! Block,i,j for debug output; use 0s to suppress
  [BLOCK                  ! BLOCK|POINT overrides default of POINT output]
  [7.890     0.           ! Optional X & F; if x > X, set finterp(:) = F]

Random target points format (mode 1):

   x1   y1   z1   Body point 1      ! Any string may follow the coordinates
   x2   y2   z2   Body point 2      ! else x is inserted as a tag
   x3   y3   z3   Wing point 1
   :    :    :    :

Tabulated output format (mode 1):

   x1   y1   z1   f11  f41  f21  Body point 1 (or x1)  Min. distance
   x2   y2   z2   f12  f42  f22  Body point 2 (or x2)    "      "
   x3   y3   z3   f13  f43  f23  Wing point 1 (or x3)    "      "

07/31/05  David Saunders  Initial implementation, adapted from BUMP_FACTORS
                          in a hurry during Discovery's return to flight.
08/12/05    "      "      Random target pts. may now be read from a simple
                          list rather than requiring Tecplot format.  The
                          smooth/damage nomenclature has been changed to
                          surface/target.
12/04/05    "      "      Added optional X and F to deal with radiative
                          heating that goes to zero beyond some X for CEV.
10/04/06    "      "      Installed Tecplot 360 version of the I/O package.
10/30/06    "      "      Turned on verbose Tecplot I/O after a mystery
                          showed up reading output from BLAYER.
11/01/06    "      "      Avoid blank zone titles for unlabeled target pts.
11/03/06    "      "      For the random points input case, write the
                          plottable results as a single (n,1,1) zone rather
                          than one zone per point.
03/26/07    "      "      Todd White asked for minimum distances to be
                          added to the tabulation for the list-of-points
                          case.
05/02/07    "      "      The mean squared minimum distance didn't have
                          npts inside the square root.
02/05/14    "      "      All ADT variants are now in a single module with
                          generic build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
