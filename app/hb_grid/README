HB_GRID was revived after 5 years of dormancy in the hope of treating MSL-like
forebodies.  A tolerable grid was obtained for Alpha = 0, but nonzero Alpha
appears difficult, with very little room to move during the shift/rotation.
Chances are the theory applies to more slender bodies (only).

With some persistence, the result may still be preferable to the oversized
initial grid that hyperbolic growth from the surface produces, but considerable
trial and error with the various fudge factors appears inevitable.
