Program THIN_GRID Description:

   THIN_GRID extracts a subset of points from all blocks of a multiblock
   grid.  This version has the option to do different things to different
   blocks, as might be needed to make a grid point-to-point matched.

   In order to avoid affecting existing scripts, the more general option is
   implemented via an optional 'thin_grid.inp.2' control.  (There is no
   'thin_grid.inp' but the '.2' is consistent with ancillary control files
   for other grid utilities.)

Optional 'thin_grid.inp.2' Control File Format:

   1 2 2 1    ! Halve the i & j density for block 1; leave nk alone
   2 2 2 1    ! ..................................2................
   3 1 1 1    ! Leave block 3 alone
   .......    ! One line per block

   (Later:)  In order to avoid duplicate points along surface patch
   edges when setting up body points for radiation calculations, another
   generalized capability has been implemented via thin_grid.inp.3 that
   allows the initial index to be something other than 1 (same for all
   blocks, since it's probably a surface grid where avoiding common edge
   points makes some sense for body point purposes, as in the case of
   a calculation on an asteroid-like shape).

Optional 'thin_grid.inp.3' Control File Format (cell-centered surface):

   i1, inc  j1, jnc  k1, knc
    3   4    3   4    1   1

Procedures:

   XYZQ_IO package  I/O utilities for PLOT3D grid and function files
