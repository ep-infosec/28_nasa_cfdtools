   program flow_interp

!  This program interpolates a flow field solution from one multiblock structured grid to another.  The solution may be either
!  cell-centered or vertex-centered.  The same underlying geometry is assumed to be represented by both grids, but the outer
!  boundaries and/or block counts and point distributions may differ.
!
!  Intended application:
!
!     >  Ideally, all target grid cells will be contained by the grid associated with the given flow solution.
!     >  For target cells outside the solution grid, the nearest solution cell is used.  Thus, extrapolation is explicitly avoided.
!     >  The standard approach has long been to use the ADT (Alternating Digital Tree) bounding-box-based technique to ensure
!        efficiency no matter how many of the target points are outside the solution grid.
!     >  Alternatively, KDTREE searches may be specified: these determine just the nearest grid point (probably a cell centroid)
!        much more efficiently than determining the best point within or on a cell and interpolation coefficients to go with it.
!        The search tree requires less memory as well, which may make this the only option on very large grids to be searched.
!     >  Most recently, a hybrid option may be specified: KDTREE searches (not on the input grid vertices, but on the associated
!        cell centroids generated here) followed by refinement with one call per search to find the nearest point to the target
!        point that is not outside the indicated closest-centroid cell.  This is an attempt to combine the best features of the
!        KDTREE and ADT methods.  Unfortunately, on typical hypersonic grids, the centroid closest to a target point may not be
!        that of the best cell that actually contains the point.  (This appears to be possible for high-aspect-ratio cells where
!        the grid spacing in some direction is varying.)  This hybrid method may still be the best compromise for interpolating
!        within very large grids.  Nearest-point (method 2) or refined-within-nearest-centroid-cell (method 3) flow values may be
!        adequate for starting new flow solutions, but the best-possible interpolated values of the standard ADT method are
!        recommended for, say, line-of-sight interpolations intended for radiation calculations.
!     >  The refinements of the hybrid method 3 cost 2.5 - 3 times the cost of the plain KDTREE method 2 results, while the ADT
!        method 1 may be as much as 100 times slower than plain KDTREE on large grids, and it requires more memory.
!     >  Note that application to different geometries (even slightly perturbed ones) is NOT appropriate:  boundary layer point
!        distributions are all-important, and the real-space interpolations performed here will not preserve the boundary layer
!        flow variables (or gradients, especially) anywhere the two surface grids differ more than infinitesimally.
!     >  Further, if the new grid points resolve surface curvature better than the grid being searched, not even the ADT method
!        can guarantee properly varying boundary layer interpolations.  Only for local problems (where the in-flow at interpolated
!        boundaries has to become a fixed boundary condition) should this be an issue, though; otherwise, the flow solver should
!        clean up the interpolated starting guess.
!     >  For interpolating just surface solutions, see RADIAL_INTERP or SURFACE_INTERP.  (RADIAL_INTERP does correct for added
!        resolution at the wall, but it assumes only one layer of grid blocks as is common for atmospheric entry vehicles, while
!        FLOW_INTERP makes no such assumption.)
!     >  This version tabulates results for the special case of single-radial-line target block(s), as needed for comparisons with
!        wind tunnel boundary layer measurements or lines of sight for radiation calculations.  Target ni = nj = 1 invokes this
!        option.  However, hemisphere lines of sight are constructed as 1 x 1 x nk blocks and produce excessive output, so if the
!        number of target blocks is excessive, we suppress this option.
!
!  Assumptions:
!
!     >  All files are PLOT3D-type, multiblock, 3-D (not 2-D), formatted or unformatted.
!     >  If the flow solution block dimensions match the grid block dimensions, the solution is assumed to be vertex-centered.
!        If they differ by 1, the solution must be cell-centered.  Any other finding means the files are inconsistent.
!
!  Clarification for DPLR Users:
!
!        DPLR-related usage normally involves cell-centered solutions with "halo" cells included.  The associated grids should
!        also be cell-centered with halo cells, in which case there is no apparent difference from vertex-centered data as far
!        as FLOW_INTERP is concerned.
!
!  Algorithm:
!
!     >  If the option to attempt suppression of input flow blocks that won't ever be needed is invoked, do the following pre-
!        processing.  (Otherwise, simply read the entire input flow solution.)
!
!        >  Read one block of the input flow grid at at time and determine the data ranges.  Rewind the file.
!
!        >  Do likewise for the target grid block(s), and determine their overall data range.  Rewind the file.
!
!        >  Determine which flow blocks to include in the search tree using a small safety margin.  (The main worry is with target
!           points that might be outside the input flow grid.  The searching then produces the point with the shortest orthogonal
!           projected distance to an outer boundary cell face.  We cannot be certain that a block suppressed via data range
!           information doesn't actually contain the best choice of cell for an "orphan" point.)
!
!        >  Set up a "grid_type" array suited to the blocks to be included, then read only those blocks.  The remaining steps are
!           the same as for the no-suppression case.
!
!     >  For each block in the target grid:
!
!        >  Read the target grid block.
!
!        >  If this is the first target block, perform some initialization:
!
!           >  If the solution is cell-centered but the grid is not, interpolate it to the vertices of the solution grid (in-place).
!              (See the above clarification about halo cells.)
!
!           >  Build the solution grid search tree from all volume cells of all (unsuppressed) blocks.  (Method 1 uses bounding
!              box techniques for the searching; method 2 builds its tree from the input solution grid points and works with just
!              distances, while method 3 builds its tree from the centroids of the input solution grid cells.)
!
!        >  For each point in the target block:
!
!           >  Locate the nearest solution cell point by searching the ADT, or just the nearest grid point if KDTREE method 2 is
!              specified, or the nearest cell centroid if KDTREE method 3 is specified.  For method 3, refine the search by
!              calculating the nearest point of the closest-centroid cell to the target point (but this cell may not be the best
!              cell - working with cell centroids is not bullet-proof the way the ADT method is).
!
!           >  Interpolate the flow solution to the current target point using the solution cell found and the interpolation
!              coefficients produced by the search (unless method = 2, in which case the flow associated with the nearest data
!              point is simply copied).
!
!              Note that the interpolations are "trilinear" within a single cell, but this familiar formulation is not really
!              linear because it contains nonlinear terms, but the effect is (tri)linear if the cell is perfectly rectangular.
!
!        >  If the input flow was cell-centered, meaning dimension differences of 1, convert the interpolated flow to be likewise.
!
!        >  Output the interpolated solution for the current block.

!  History:
!
!     03/24/04  DAS  Initial implementation, styled after GRID_MORPH_1, with argument-driven INTERP_Q portion reusable.
!     03/29/04   "   Introduced face_type structure to help identify exterior faces of blocks.
!     04/04/04   "   Made use of xyzq_io package.
!     06/15/04   "   Replaced RIPPLE3D with a volume grid version of the Alternating Digital Tree package from Stanford.
!     02/01/05   "   Added special treatment of boundary layer profiles defined as single radial line(s) in the target block(s).
!     05/12/06   "   The profile tabulation format now handles any number of functions, not 6 or fewer.
!     08/07/08   "   Todd White suggested an option to suppress solution blocks in the hope of speeding things up in some cases.
!                    He also has parallelization in mind.
!     08/08/08   "   A case involving 1.5 million target points and 2 x 8.7 million points from 2 x 47 blocks (full Shuttle) takes
!                    9.5 minutes the standard way and 8 minutes if only the relevant 21 blocks are searched.  This represents only
!                    a modest 16% reduction on a demanding case, so the standard approach has been quite efficient all along.
!                    The printout at the end of each k plane has been commented out now.
!     08/22/08   "   The format flag for the target file was being passed as that for the solution file.
!     06/06/10   "   The 08/08/08 history comment above had typos.  No other change was made.
!     06/24/13   "   Option to use KDTREE searches for nearest points (centroids) only.  This may be adequate for some purposes
!                    such as starting some flow solutions, and uses less memory.  It's about 2 orders of magnitude faster.
!     07/26/13   "   Hybrid method refines each KDTREE result by computing the best point (+ associated interpolation coefficients)
!                    within the indicated cell.  This is 2.5 - 3 x slower than plain KDTREE, but still much faster than plain ADT
!                    on large grids.  Note that, for DPLR applications, the input grid and flow are normally at cell centers,
!                    treated as vertices here.  But the hybrid KDTREE + refinement method requires the search to identify a best
!                    cell, not vertex, so we actually generate and search the centroids of the input grid cells.  This does take
!                    more memory, but not as much as the ADT search tree requires (which is 18 reals + 8 integers per cell).
!     07/30/13   "   Replaced nearest_hex_point (intended for unstructured grids) with the analogous nearest_brick_point (suited to
!                    structured grids).  Clarified the potential imprecision of the hybrid method 3.  As explained above, the
!                    hybrid method is not guaranteed to find the best cell for each search - it merely finds the cell whose
!                    centroid is closest to the target, but some other cell(s) may actually contain the target.
!     08/05/13   "   All ADT variants have been combined into a module now for distribution reasons (generic build & search calls).
!     02/22/17   "   Suppress profile tabulation (to standard output) if the target grid seems to be a set of hemisphere lines of
!                    sight (more than 100 blocks, all 1 x 1 x nk).
!     10/15/19   "   Mysterious interpolations along lines of sight for radiation calculations revealed that the hybrid method 3 is
!                    potentially seriously flawed.  At a shock envelope boundary, volume grid cells are typically close together
!                    near the shock in the off-wall direction, yet relatively large in the surface index directions. This means that
!                    cell centroids can be a poor measure of the correct cells within which to refine interpolation coefficients.
!                    Method 1 (ADT searching) has been adjusted to cope with occasional matrix singularity observed in boundary
!                    layer regions, and is strongly recommended as the preferred method where practical. The advice presented above
!                    under "Intended application" remains valid.

!  This routine interpolates the given flow solution onto the indicated block of a target grid.
!  It is the argument-driven, reusable portion of program flow_interp, q.v.  Briefly, it handles cell-centered or
!  vertex-centered flow solutions, assumes the surface grids match very closely, and treats one target block at a time
!  so the calling program can avoid storing more than that if there is no real need to do so.

!  03/26/04   "   Use the result from the previous i if possible.

!  04/07/04   "   The previous (ic,jc,kc) was being lost in the loop over solution blocks when the new target is outside a block.
!  06/15/04   "   Replaced RIPPLE3D with a volume grid version of the Alternating Digital Tree package from Stanford.
!  02/01/05   "   Added special treatment of boundary layer profiles or lines of sight defined as single radial line(s) in the
!                 target block(s).
!  08/07/08   "   The data range calculations have been suppressed following the option at the higher level to look for solution

!                 This requires searching cell centroids (generated here), not cell vertices.

!  08/05/13   "   All ADT variants have been combined into a module now for distribution reasons (generic build & search calls).
!  02/22/17   "   Added nblocks_target argument in order to suppress profile tabulations for excessive numbers of profiles that
