NPOPT_DRIVER provides a framework for performing constrained optimization
via NPOPT, including the option to perform a sequence of such optimizations
that are presumably related.  A new application should be able to confine
its specifics to fun.f90, which includes subroutine nlcon, called by both
confun.f90 and subroutine summary in fun.f90.

The initial implementation has been adapted from the QNMDRIVER3 framework
for a sequence of unconstrained optimization, and HEAT_SHIELD, which uses
NPOPT for a single constrained optimization.  Marrying the two proved
awkward, but a table-driven scheme for any linear and nonlinear constraints
has helped.

The generalized Rosenbrock function has been employed as a demonstration.
See fun.f90, which includes two kludged nonlinear constraints but no
example of linear constraints.

FIAT_Opt is a more complex example, available from the CFD_Utilities
maintainers.

The NPOPT package is available from Stanford University.
