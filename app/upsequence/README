Description:

   UPSEQUENCE is a specialized utility for treating coarse-grid forms of
   the multiblock flow solutions for cavity or plug configurations produced
   by NASA Ames procedures for rapid local analysis of damage/repair with
   known grid topology.  It simply copies the coarse grid solution to the
   finer grid cells indicated by iseq, jseq, kseq (same for all blocks is
   assumed), and then transcribes the outer boundary flow from the original
   fine-grid solution starting guess as part of speeding the calculation on
   the finer grid.

   All flow solution files should contain cell-centered data with halo
   cells included.

Assumptions for cavity cases:

   o  6 blocks, with block 6 in the cavity (no outer boundary)

Assumptions for plug cases:

   o  13 blocks, with blocks 1:5 above the plug (kmax boundary to treat)

   o  Blocks 6:13 have their jmax faces at outer local boundaries

Assumptions for gap filler cases:

   o  9 blocks, with blocks 1:5 above the filler (kmax boundary to treat)

   o  Blocks 2:9 have their jmax faces at outer local boundaries

Procedures:

   XYZQ_IO package  I/O utilities for PLOT3D grid and function files

History:

   06/06/2006  D. Saunders  Adaptation of THIN_FLOW.
   06/07/2006   "       "   Testing via THIN_GRID was misleading: more
                            care is needed, treating interior cells the
                            expected way and halo cells separately.
   09/13/2006   "       "   Added the gap-filler case.
