REORDER_ROWS Description:

Purpose:

   Reorder the (significant) rows in a tabulation so that the leading n
   columns (presumed to be coordinates of a rectangular table for one or
   more equal-sized "blocks") vary most rapidly in a different way.

   The number of dimensions, n, may be 2 or 3 initially, but this could be
   extended up to 7, which is the Fortran limit on number of subscripts.

   This was prompted by a need to reorder an aerothermal database so that
   the first 3 columns vary in the Fortran order (column 1 most rapidly,
   column 2 next most rapidly, and so on).

   File names, etc., are prompted for - there is no control file.

Strategy:

   Header records tell how many dimensions, subtables, etc., but the number
   of pure text lines heading each subtable is prompted for, along with the
   desired output order.

   All lines are read as character strings and stored in arrays for writing
   in the specified order.

   The column order is preserved; see "extract_columns" for revising it.

   Sample Input (aerothermal database):

      2    # surface points  (1: stagnation, 2: shoulder)  (# subtables)
      11   # alphas
      25   # Machs
      19   # dynamic pressures
     // Point: 1 triangle: 5371     3.41388  0.0434033  -1.56086, id = 1010

   The example shown has column 3 values varying most rapidly and column 1
   values varying least rapidly.  Enter 321 at the appropriate prompt for
   the existing order or permutation.

   To change the row order so that the 2nd column values vary most rapidly
   and the 3rd column values least rapidly, enter 213 as the desired output
   permutation.
