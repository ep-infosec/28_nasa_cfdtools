Program REFLECT_BLOCKS_2D Description:

   This is the 2D analogue of REFLECT_BLOCKS, from which it is adapted.

   REFLECT_BLOCKS_2D reflects the blocks of a multiblock grid in the plane
specified.  An optional function file may also be reflected.  Either both
halves or just the reflected half may be output.  An option to force
exact zeros at the symmetry plane is provided.  If a function file is
present, one or more quantities may have the sign changed as part of the
reflection.  Normally this would be just one velocity component.

   The function file may represent either a vertex- or cell-centered
solution, with or without halo cells.  (Only the number of blocks is
required to match that of the grid.)

Procedures:

   XYQ_IO package  I/O utilities for PLOT3D grid and function files
   RDLIST          Utility for reading an indefinite list of integers
