Description:

      SCAN_GRID scans the specified block(s) of a grid to determine such
   characteristics as the data range. This version can also read a function
   file as might be needed to locate (for instance) maximum residuals in a
   flow solution.

Implementation Notes:

      Simply scanning all blocks sequentially would allow storing of only
   one block at a time.  However, providing an inner loop over index sub-
   ranges of a specified block makes it awkward not to store the entire
   grid.

      If a function file is present, the program does indeed store just one
   block at a time and allows just one of the functions to be scanned per
   run.  Use something like Tecplot to scrutinize particular points of
   particular blocks if function values are needed as well as coordinates.
