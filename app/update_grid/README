Program UPDATE_GRID description:

   UPDATE_GRID overwrites the indicated block(s) of a multiblock grid.
Blocks being replaced should be specified in ascending order so that
only one block needs to be stored at a time.  The dimensions of the
block(s) being replaced cannot change.

   UPDATE_GRID might be used in conjunction with GSMOOTH, which smooths
one block of a grid at a time.

Known weakness:

   If more than one block is being updated from the same replacement file,
there is no attempt to suppress the prompt for that file (it is done from
within the I/O package) or to avoid repeated reads from the top of the
file to the desired blocks.  The anticipated usage is with multiple
single-block files being plugged into one multiblock file.  Substituting
patches in a surface grid is another possibility.

History:
