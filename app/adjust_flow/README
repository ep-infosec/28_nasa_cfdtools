This adaptation of ADJUST_GRID offers just the transformations that would
affect the velocity components of a flow solution containing the state
variables, and applies them to both the flow data and the corresponding
grid.  Both input files should be either cell-centered or vertex-centered,
in PLOT3D format.

For convenience, the options to shift x, y, or z are retained.
