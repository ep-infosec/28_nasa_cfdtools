Description:

   V2C converts a grid and optional flow variables from cell vertices to
   cell centers.  It is restricted to 3-space multiblock grids, and auto-
   matically determines whether the input grid is formatted or not.  The
   output format must still be prompted for.

   DPLR-type halo cells may be included/suppressed in the output file(s).
   Halo cells are on the grid block boundaries.

   The grid may represent a volume, a surface, or just a line. There can be
   no halo cells in degenerate directions.  Thus, input dimension n becomes
   (in the output) either n + 1 (halos included), n - 1 (halos suppressed)
   or 1 if n = 1.

   Original intentions of providing cell-centers-to-vertices options have
   been abandoned as redundant.

Procedures:

   DETERMINE_GRID_FORM   Distinguishes betw/ formatted & unformatted grids
   READER                Prompting utility
   XYZQ_IO               I/O utilities for PLOT3D-type multiblock grids
   VERTICES_TO_CENTERS   Subroutine that does most of the work

History:

   02/05/08  D.A.Saunders  Initial implementation.
   01/06/10    "     "     Todd White noticed that outputs with no halos
                           weren't right at the high end in each index.
                           Only subr. vertices_to_centers needed a fix.
   07/30/15    "     "     Added handling of 2-space files.
   11/06/15    "     "     A 2D output function file was using the wrong
                           logical formatting variable.
