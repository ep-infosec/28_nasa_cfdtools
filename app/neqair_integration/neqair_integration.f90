   program neqair_integration
!
!  First Words:
!
!  Most of the documentation here applies to the original form that worked with
!  a single output from NEQAIR per line of sight, namely the radiance at a body
!  point integrated over all wavelengths.  This usage is expected to remain the
!  most common, so the original coding is retained as far as possible.  A major
!  extension here treats NEQAIR's more bulky outputs showing wave length regions
!  with spectral radiances computed for many wavelengths.  Either intensity.out
!  or intensity_scanned.out files are treated. Only one of these (not both) is
!  expected in each /LINE-* directory for which NEQAIR has been run, and their
!  presence or absence in /LINE-1 is determined automatically. If neither file
!  is present, the original single-radiance-per-line case is assumed.
!
!  Introduction (Original Form):
!
!  This somewhat specialized application is a companion to HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT
!  and NEQAIR_DATA, NEQAIR being a radiative heating solver long used at NASA
!  Ames Research Center.  Each run of NEQAIR operates on one line of sight's
!  worth of real gas flow data to compute the radiance impinging on some body
!  surface point of a hypersonic vehicle in the direction of that line.  Most
!  often, this line is normal to the body, and then a 1-D flow assumption is
!  made to compute a "tangent-slab" approximation to integrating the effect of
!  all possible lines of sight, giving an upper-bound estimate of the radiative
!  heat flux at that body point.  Approximating all possible lines of sight
!  reaching a body point requires much more work.
!
!  Typical atmospheric entry vehicles are relatively simple convex bodies, any
!  point of which can be "seen" by flow field radiation coming from all of the
!  directions defined by a hemisphere centered at the point, tangent to the
!  body.  HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT produces a discretization of such a hemisphere
!  at the specified body point(s) in the form of straight lines that have been
!  intersected with the outer boundary of the computational volume grid.  The
!  surface triangulation of points on that outer boundary associated with a
!  given body point, along with NEQAIR radiance results for each line of sight,
!  are gathered by this utility which then performs full angular integration
!  with respect to solid angle to give a more thorough estimate of the radiative
!  heat flux at the body point, the accuracy of which depends on the coarseness
!  of the underlying hemisphere triangulation.
!
!  Further Preliminary Details:
!
!  Consider a run of HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT for a pair of body points on the aft
!  parachute cone centerline, using "parachute" as the identifier.  Since both
!  points have y = 0, only half a hemisphere is needed.  This contains two of
!  the underlying discretized quadrants, suitably transformed.  Two sets of
!  three files are produced as follows:
!
!     parachute.1.hemi.dat      ! Transformed/unintersected/2-zone Tecplot file
!     parachute.1.boundary.dat  ! Intersected form of the above triangulation
!     parachute.1.lines.g       ! PLOT3D file of all 1x1xnk intersected lines
!
!     parachute.2.hemi.dat      ! Repeat for body point 2 ...
!     parachute.2.boundary.dat
!     parachute.2.lines.g
!
!  Also, the initial triangulated quadrant centered in (0,0,0) is saved as:
!
!     unit_hemi_quadrant_vertices.dat
!
!  Alternative nomenclature from USLOS or SLOS rather than HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT:
!
!  Only one set of hemisphere lines is produced per run of USLOS or SLOS:
!
!     transformed_unit_hemi.dat ! Transformed/unintersected/2-zone triangulation
!                               ! centered on the body point
!     intersected_boundary.dat  ! Intersected form of the above triangulation
!     los.g                     ! 1x1xnk lines of sight in PLOT3D format
!
!  Plottable radiance datasets:
!
!     radiance_normal_components.dat  ! On the intersected boundary surface
!     radiance_normal_hemi.dat        ! On the unintersected hemisphere surface
!
!  The ID.n.hemi.dat files are for visual inspection.  The ID.n.lines.g files
!  contain 2 x nnodes "blocks" of dimensions 1 x 1 x nk, where nnodes is the
!  number of vertices in one quadrant of the triangulated hemisphere.  Each
!  ID.n.lines.g is input to FLOW_INTERP along with temperature and species
!  number density volume data and the associated volume grid (half the full
!  volume in this case, but both halves if any body point is off the y = 0
!  centerline).  The ...boundary.dat files are retrieved here, but NEQAIR_DATA
!  and then NEQAIR have to be run first.
!
!  For body point 1, parachute.1.lines.g and parachute.1.lines.f are passed to
!  NEQAIR_DATA, which produces lines in the form expected by NEQAIR, named
!  LOS-1.dat, LOS-2.dat, ..., LOS-m.dat where m = 2*nnodes in this case, or
!  4*nnodes for an off-center body point.
!
!  NOTE:  Treating more than one body point at a time with HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT
!         and subsequent NEQAIR steps is not recommended, so the point number
!         in the nomenclature is highly likely to be 1 (only).  The later USLOS
!         and SLOS eliminate this unnecessary aspect of the nomenclature, but
!         the integration allows for both forms.  Their output lines of sight
!         are written to los.g.
!
!  A shell script can then run NEQAIR on all lines associated with one body
!  point, with its tangent-slab integration step turned off, producing sub-
!  directories /LINE-1, /LINE-2, ..., /LINE-m each containing a neqair.out
!  file with a radiance value on the last line.  (Common edge points are
!  retained in the quadrants to simplify the quadrature performed here, at the
!  cost of some repeated NEQAIR runs.)
!
!  If more than one body point is in the picture, each needs to be in its own
!  subdirectory because the LOS-*.dat files and /LINE-* subdirectory names do
!  not carry the ID along.  See the NOTE above.
!
!  Adjustments For Radiometer Cone Angle < 90 degrees:
!
!  If HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT has been used with a cone angle less than 90 deg.
!  entered as a 4th number (say 35.) on the body point x/y/z line, the lines
!  processed by NEQAIR_DATA should be those written to the additional file
!  cone.35.00.parachute.1.lines.g.  These are the only lines for which NEQAIR
!  needs to be run.  The angle calculations used to determine which hemisphere
!  lines to suppress are used here to read NEQAIR results for those lines only,
!  and to zero the radiance values for the remainder.  The quadrature can then
!  proceed over the whole hemispherical triangulation as before.
!
!  Provision is also made for examining a cone angle smaller than the cone angle
!  for which NEQAIR runs are in hand.  However, note that the smaller the cone
!  angle, the denser the underlying discretization can and should be for reason-
!  able resolution.
!
!  NEQAIR_INTEGRATION Procedure (Original Form; Cone Angle = 90 degrees):
!
!  For one body point, at the level above subdirectories /LINE-1, /LINE-2, ...
!  the user of this program enters the relevant ID and body point number (say
!  parachute and 1).  File parachute.1.boundary.dat is read in a loop over (2)
!  zones.  For each zone, nnodes lines are processed by extracting a radiance
!  value from the last line of the appropriate /LINE-*/neqair.out file into
!  the %f(1,:) elements of the zone/quadrant triangulation's function array
!  to match its %xyz(1:3,:) coordinates, followed with a call to low-level
!  subroutine solid_angle_quadrature_3 to produce a measure of radiative heat
!  flux at the body point for that quadrant/zone.  The sum over all quadrants
!  for one body point is the final heat flux for that body point.
!
!  Extensions For Distinguishing Wavelength Dependencies:
!
!  Wavelength-dependent integrations w.r.t. solid angle are saved as the file
!  integrations.dat, along with one radiance per line further described below.
!  The main complication is that storing all the data in intensity.out or
!  intensity_scanned.out could require vast amounts of memory. Ensuring a
!  common set of wavelengths for all regions of all lines, and storing only
!  one line's worth of data at a time is far more efficient (thanks to Brett
!  Cruden for this insight).  The added complexity is isolated as much as
!  possible so that the original scheme for which solid_angle_quadrature_3 was
!  written can be retained.  Both the original and the extended schemes allow
!  radiometer cone angles less than 90 (meaning NEQAIR output data are present
!  for only a subset of hemisphere lines) and possibly further analyses with
!  cone angles specified as smaller than the cone angle of the data.  The same
!  choice of zeroing function values for lines outside the indicated cone angle
!  simplifies the integrations in all cases. For each line, an integration
!  w.r.t. wavelength produces a radiance saved as /LINE-*/radiance.out, and
!  these can be integrated w.r.t. solid angle as a check that should match the
!  original integration scheme for single radiances produced by NEQAIR.
!  In /LINE-1 (only) the file line-1.cumulative.dat contains the partial
!  integrals w.r.t. wavelength for each common uniform wavelength.
!  Any radiance.out files in /LINE-* should be deleted before a run intended
!  to process intensity[_scanned].out files, because the program automates
!  the type of integration performed according to the files found in /LINE-1.

      subroutine analyze_wavelengths ()
!
!     This major extension to neqair_integration performs its original function
!     for each wavelength of each region analyzed by NEQAIR.  It is isolated to
!     leave the original scheme essentially intact, although that scheme can be
!     reused following analysis of intensity_scanned.out or intensity.out files
!     by processing the one-line radiance.out files that are written at the end
!     of the more elaborate analysis by integrating w.r.t. wavelength for each
!     line of sight.
!
!     To be more precise, a common set of wavelengths has to be imposed on each
!     line before any integrations.  This is done by scanning all lines for the
!     maximum number of (uniform?) wavelengths in each region and interpolating
!     the spectral radiances to uniform wavelengths that are dense enough not to
!     lose resolution in any region of any line.
!
!     Storing all of the functions (possibly millions of spectral radiances) for
!     all of the lines in order to do the integrations the way they are done in
!     the original scheme would require prohibitive amounts of memory. Instead,
!     one line can be processed at a time and a summation can be performed for
!     each (common) wavelength.  Thanks to Brett Cruden for pointing this out.
!     Consider the 1-D trapezoidal rule analog to see this more easily.

!
!     For each uniform wavelength derived from the wavelengths found in many
!     intensity[_scanned].out files produced by NEQAIR, integrate the spectral
!     radiances w.r.t. solid angle, probably over the hemisphere triangulation
!     elements contained within an active radiometer cone angle that may be
!     equal to or smaller than the data cone angle used in HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT
!     to determine the lines of sight for which NEQAIR is run.
!
!     The original scheme used for single radiance outputs from NEQAIR would
!     require exorbitant amounts of memory to set up all the function data ready
!     for integration. Instead, one line is processed at a time and a summation
!     is performed for each (common) wavelength.  Brett Cruden pointed out this
!     more efficient approach.  Consider the 1-D trapezoidal rule analog to
!     understand it more readily. The cell-centered function values are taken to
!     be the average of triangle vertex values.  Only the body-normal components
