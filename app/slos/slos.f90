!  Description:
!
!     SLOS has been adapted from USLOS (unstructured [grid] lines of sight),
!     itself an adaptation of LINES_OF_SIGHT and HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT, which
!     are now superseded by this combination of the two purposes (body-normal
!     lines for tangent-slab radiation calculations, or hemispherical lines
!     for just one body point at a time) for the 3D structured grid case.
!     (See also LINES_OF_SIGHT_2D.)
!
!     The volume grid is expected to be right-handed, and for the hemisphere
!     case, the y >= 0 half is expected (with x pointing downstream).  An off-
!     center body point requires both halves for the hemisphere case.
!
!     The inner surface is expected to represent a mostly-convex surface.  Any
!     concavities may cause difficulties with hemisphere lines that encounter
!     the body.  Ancillary utility ADJUST_HEMISPHERE_LOS is the initial answer
!     for such cases.
!
!  Body Point Inputs (one entry per line; trailing comments ignored):
!
!     Body-normal (tangent-slab radiation calculation) case:
!
!        0.  0.  0.
!        1.628659741950E-01  5.741545696080E-01  0.  ! Nose/cone tangency
!        8.985316209400E-01  1.837811469800E+00  0.  ! Cone/shoulder tangency
!         :                   :                   :
!
!        If only one body point is detected, a prompt still allows for the
!        tangent-slab case.
!
!     Hemispherical lines (full angular integration) case:
!
!        1.0742  -1.81  1.083  [10.]  ! x, y, z[, cone angle]
!
!        Only one body point is handled for this case.  The optional semi-cone
!        angle allows for writing fewer than the full hemisphere's worth of
!        lines to avoid unnecessary radiation cone angles outside the viewing
!        angle of a radiometer instrument.  Note that NEQAIR_INTEGRATION can
!        still integrate over a narrower angle than the indicated data angle.
!        If the optional angle is omitted, it is taken to be 90 degrees.
!
!  Input Structured Volume Grid (PLOT3D Format):
!
!     Formatted or unformatted multiblock files are handled, and a single layer
!     of grid blocks is assumed (normally the case for hypersonic vehicles) so
!     that the outer surface of all blocks serves as the shock-aligned boundary
!     with which intersections of lines from the body point(s) are calculated.
!
!  Outputs:
!
!     While the precursors of SLOS discretize the lines of sight with the same
!     relative point distributions as found in the nearest off-body grid line,
!     this variant follows the USLOS approach of using DPLR-type controls nk,
!     d1, and ds2_fraction that are prompted for.
!
!     The lines of sight are written to a single multiblock PLOT3D-type file,
!     one line per block.  These should be checked visually before proceeding
!     with radiation calculations.  Ensuing procedures will interpolate flow
!     data onto the discretized lines of sight and write results compatible with
!     the radiation solver.  The file name is hard-coded as 'los.g' as part
!     of simplifying the original nomenclature.
!
!  Method:
!
!     >  A handful of prompts serve to drive the program -- no control file.
!     >  Read the indicated body point (x,y,z) file -- one or more points.
!     >  If a single body point is found, prompt in case hemispherical lines are
!        NOT intended.
!     >  If all body points are on the centerline (y = 0.), the input volume
!        grid is assumed to be the starboard (right) half.  That half (y > 0.)
!        also serves for off-center body-normal lines, but for a hemisphere at
!        an off-center body point, a full volume grid is expected, with the
!        outer surface closed and convex.
!     >  Build a search tree from the inner multiblock surface, and search
!        for each body point.
!     >  Generate and store the corresponding unit body-normal vector(s).
!     >  Build a new search tree from the outer boundary, as needed for line-
!        surface intersection calculations.
!
!     >  Body-normal line case:
!           >  For each body point B:
!              >  The body normal unit vector is already in hand.
!              >  A search interval along the body-normal line for minimizing
!                 the distance to the outer surface is provided by s = 0 at the
!                 low end and s = the diagonal of the bounding box for the
!                 outer surface mesh.
!              >  The intersection point is then conveniently calculated via
!                 a 1D minimization w.r.t. distance s from B along the body-
!                 normal line (INTSEC6).
!              >  Impose a CFD-type point distribution on the intersected
!                 interval BP, as needed for interpolated flow field data.
!                 DPLR-type use of inputs nk, ds1, ds2fraction will suffice.
!           >  Write the discretized line(s) of sight to the indicated PLOT3D-
!              type output file.
!
!     >  Hemisphere lines of sight case:
!           >  The vertices of a triangulated unit hemispherical quadrant define
!              the lines of sight between the body point and the outer grid
!              boundary.  The number of uniform points specified along an edge
!              determines the resolution.  Typically, 25 such points are used,
!              giving 650 lines of sight for a centerline body point, or 1300
!              lines if the body point is off-center.  Centerline points require
!              just half the volume data, and the eventual integration over
!              solid angle of radiances from the lines of sight can be doubled.
!        >  Triangulation choice:
!              This version of SLOS has the option to read a previously generat-
!              ed unit triangulation that the Equal_Area_Triangulation variant
!              of the NPOPT_DRIVER framework can now produce.  If nedge is spec-
!              ified as 25 (say), we look for the file unit_sphere_octant_25.dat
!              (likewise for other nedge values).  If the file is not found, the
!              spherical_triangulation subroutine is employed as originally.
!              In principle, the integrations w.r.t. solid angle of radiances
!              calculated for each line of sight will be more accurate if the
!              solid angle elements are essentially equal, although it is ex-
!              pected that the two kinds of triangulation will produce very
!              similar results for a given value of nedge.
!           >  The initial unit quadrant is transformed so that line 1/vertex 1
!              corresponds to the body point normal. After The lines for the
!              first quadrant are generated, the quadrant is rotated 90 degrees
!              about the normal and the next set of lines is generated.  Then if
!              the body point is off-center, this is repeated twice more.
!           >  Each intersection involves a 2-point line from the body point
!              through a quadrant vertex, of length derived from the bounding
!              box of the outer shock surface.  This length is overkill for many
!              intersection search intervals, but that doesn't matter.  Each
!              hemisphere line is intersected and discretized as for the body
!              normal (tangent-slab) case described above.

!                               The option for entering body point indices in
!                               lieu of x/y/z coordinates has been dispensed
!                               with.  Use GU to coarsen a surface grid if
!                               necessary.  Generation of shock-normal lines
!                               and lines parallel to Ox have also been omitted.
!                               Use the original LINES_OF_SIGHT for these.

!     10/04/2019    "    "      Resetting the lower intersection search interval
!                               to zero was not being done for each new line.
!                               Earlier testing must not have encountered any
!                               intersection failures that are caused by outer
!                               grid boundaries that are not strictly convex!
!     10/05/2019    "    "      Failed intersections prompted another way of
!                               retrying: discretize the part of the line beyond
!                               the failed solution and evaluate line-surface
!                               distances from those points; pick the interval
!                               containing the smallest distance, and redo the
!                               line-surface intersection.  REMEMBER THAT THE
!                               ARC LENGTH INTERVAL PASSED TO INTSEC6 SHOULD BE
!                               NORMALIZED BY THE LINE LENGTH IF THAT IS THE

!                               too big.  Body points near the nose (normally

      subroutine transform_quadrant (un, m)
!
!     A quadrant of a triangulated unit hemisphere is transformed 2 or 4 times
!     to define all the lines of sight for one body point.  Processing for each
!     quadrant is completed before the next.  For the first quadrant (m = 1),
!     the unit quadrant is transformed so that its primary axis along Ox is
!     coincident with the unit normal at the body point. Each next quadrant is
!     obtained by rotating the previous quadrant 90 degrees about the body
!     normal.  The un(:) argument is needed because subroutine hemisphere_lines
!     is a local procedure here but it is the essence of the main program in
!     HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT, much of which has been transcribed.  The muddle of
!     global and local variables is the result of sharing code with the portion
!     that has been transcribed from LINES_OF_SIGHT.
