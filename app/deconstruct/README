Program DECONSTRUCT description:

   Convert a multiblock structured surface or volume grid to a surface
triangulation or tetrahedral volume mesh.  Quadrilaterals become pairs
of triangles; hex cells become five tetrahedra each.

Outputs are in Tecplot format, as a single zone.

Procedures:

   XYZQ_IO package  I/O utilities for PLOT3D grid and function files

History:

   08/16/04  D. Saunders  Initial adaptation of EXTRACT_BLOCKS, to
                          provide data for testing the tetrahedral mesh
                          variant of the ADT search package.
