Original TEMPLATE Description:
------------------------------

   Make a FLO107MB connection file template from a PLOT3D grid file.
   The name 'template' is used because most but not all of the block
   face connectivity/boundary condition information can be deduced
   from just the grid, although some educated guesses are applied to
   the faces that seem not to match other block faces.

   The grid file may be single or mgrid, real*4 or real*8, though it
   only makes sense to process multiblock grids.

   Use "template -v" for verbose template.con file (last column will
   indicate what fraction of quads of discovered abutting faces match
   within epsilon distance at all four corners.

   (This version turns on "-v" explicitly.)

   There are nb blocks, the nth block has dimensions nj(n),nk(n),nl(n).
   Each block becomes a network of six patches, one for each side.  The
   sides are numbered 1 to 6 as:  jmin, jmax, kmin, kmax, lmin, lmax.
   Each quad face of each side of each block is stored as a four-tuple
   of integers that point into xyz.  Component numbers are the sides
   1-6 for the first block, then 7-12 for the second block, and so on
   to 6*nb.  An index array iaf into ndf points to the nth component's
   quads which range from iaf(n) to iaf(n+1)-1.  The xtrema array is
   used to store the xyz minmax values for each component (for each
   side of each block).  The component xyz extrema are used to match
   sides within epsilon.  ihand(n) is the handedness of the nth block,
   right=1, left=-1; it is found roughly by adding some tet volumes and
   checking the sign of the result.

DPLR Input and Interface Files:

   This version writes a GASP control file and two DPLR control files
   as well, and handles formatted grids as well as the original real*4
   or real*8 unformatted.

Ancillary control file 'template.inp.2' usage:

   No 'template.inp' control file is in the picture here, but the name
   'template.inp.2' is used for this optional control file to be consistent
   with other grid manipulation utilities.

   The leading keyword on the first of each optional pair of input lines is
   converted to upper case here, and only the first 4 characters are used.

   Pairs of control lines are read until EOF, so the order of the pairs
   does not matter.

Optional usage (1) (obsolete with DPLR V4.03, since ntx/y/z are gone now):

   Control the type of sequencing (grid coarsening) specified in the
   'dplr.inputs.2' output.  Originally, 2 2 1 coarsening was hard-coded.
   Now, a pair of lines as shown can produce whatever is really needed.
   The default coarsening remains 2 2 1.  Example:

   Sequencing controls
   4 4 2              ! Coarsening factors in the i, j, k directions

Optional usage (2):

   Force boundary condition changes in the two DPLR control files as needed
   for proper analysis of cavity or plug repair cases.

   Cavity block(s)    ! Any BC 1 or 2 will be changed to BC 26 (wall)
   6                  ! Any reasonable list of block numbers

or

   Plug blocks        ! BC 2 at jmin will be changed to BC 26 (wall)
   10:13              ! Any reasonable list of block numbers

History beyond Scott's original implementation:
-----------------------------------------------

  [Note that Scott uses a pre-Fortran 90 form of dynamic memory allocation
   that appears more trouble than it is worth to replace with the modern
   forms of allocate and deallocate.]
