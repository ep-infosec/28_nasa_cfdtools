   LOC Description and Usage:

         A quick-and-dirty filter for counting lines of FORTRAN code
      in an ASCII file.  We count everything EXCEPT blanks and lines
      which begin with 'C' in column 1.  [Other comment characters are
      now handled -- see the history.]  Total lines and lines of code
      are reported to the terminal, and the user is prompted for another
      source file.


   Input format:

         Any ASCII file.  Only the first 72 columns are examined.


   External files:

      Unit    I/O/S  Description
       4      I      Source code file to be filtered.
       5      I      User keyboard.
       6        O    User terminal screen.


   Environment:  Digital VAX-11/780 VMS/V4.1 FORTRAN.


   Notes:

      (1)  IMPLICIT NONE is non-standard, and some of the variable
           names are longer than six characters.

      (2)  We don't trace INCLUDE files.

      (3)  VT100 escape codes are ANSI standard (I hope).

      (4)  Use of CHAR function in PARAMETER statement is non-standard.

   Development history:

       1 Oct. 1985    RAK    Initial design and coding.
       5 Mar. 1986    RAK    Added READONLY keyword in the OPEN to
                             facilitate snooping in other people's
                             directories.  "Clarity coefficient"
                             displayed.  Playing with VT100 emphasis
                             features for main results and errors.
                             Added explicit CLOSE (was previously
                             unable to look at same file twice).
                             Use OPENER to prompt for and open the
                             input file.
      30 May  1986    DAS    Took advantage of revised OPENER (which
                             now returns if filename is left blank).
      20 May  1988    DAS    Introduced GETLINE to deal with trailing
                             '!'-type comments properly; allowed '*'
                             as well as 'C', 'c' for column 1 comments.
      28 Jan. 2000    DAS    I5 format didn't allow for really large
                             line counts.
