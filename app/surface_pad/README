SURFACE_PAD Description:

For a structured surface grid (one or more patches), apply 1-dimensional
interpolations versus arc length to pad the number(s) of points.  Existing
program MSPLINE should be able to do this, but it seems to fail for surface
grids, and it preserves relative arc lengths where one might prefer roughly
uniform distributions as offered (only) here, at least initially.

Either or both index directions may be treated, patch by patch.  If the i
direction is specified, it is treated first.  Those results are further
interpolated in the j direction if so-specified.  (Program ADJUST_GRID can
transpose indices if some other order is desired.)

Two-dimensional surface interpolations are avoided, since the nonlinear
ones are dubious at best in the author's experience.

Modest numbers of data points are anticipated, for which existing sub-
routine uniform_edge is appropriate (although its linear interpolation
option for specified index intervals is unlikely to be made use of here).

Input and output files are in PLOT3D format, ASCII or unformatted.

                  points for a multiple of m should be m*(n-1) + 1.
