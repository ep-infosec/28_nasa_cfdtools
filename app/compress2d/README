COMPRESS2D Description:

   This specialized program adjusts the single-block hyperbolic 2D volume
   grid associated with a generatrix from CAPSULE_GRID by compressing its
   forward portion to improve initial flow calculations.  It prompts for a
   handful of controls.  A heuristic new forward boundary is established as
   a 2-space local parametric cubic spline (x and y vs. arc length) and the
   input radial grid lines are intersected with it then redistributed.  The
   untouched radial lines are also redistributed to ensure smooth blending
   of the radial grid spacings.

   The number of points in the radial direction for the output grid can be
   changed along with the wall spacing (some constant) and outermost
   spacings.

Input Grid Format (from Gridgen glf file, with z = 0 everywhere):

         1
       285      101        1
   0.0000000000e+00  8.9617965000e-06  3.5930872000e-05  8.0875672000e-05
   1.4379119000e-04  2.2467045000e-04  3.2350445000e-04  4.4028221000e-04
    :                 :                 :                 :

   The input grid is assumed to have i along the surface and j in the
   radial direction.

Option to Derive a 3D Volume Grid From the Compressed 2D Grid:

   "Umbrella" (faceted and open at the back) full-body surface grids have
   been found difficult to grow hyperbolic volume grids from in Gridgen.
   Therefore, an option is provided to read a spoked form of the faceted
   surface grid and morph the plane 2D hyperbolic grid to each azimuthal
   station of the spoked surface.

   The expected surfaces are spoked_surface_fore.g and spoked_surface_aft.g
   from CAPSULE_GRID.  The option is invoked automatically if the first of
   these is found in the working directory, but a prompt allows skipping
   this volume gridding if the 2D compression controls still need to be
   checked graphically, if the surface is axisymmetric, or if there is no
   aft body.
