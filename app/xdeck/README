XDECK can remove trailing and/or leading columns & trailing spaces.
It shows its age, but proved handy during preparation of the README
files for this web site from the application program headers.

XDECK is a program originally intended to remove the deck-names or
sequence numbers in columns 73-80 of files derived from card decks
or from the UPDATE facility on the CDC 7600,  and to eliminate any
trailing blanks.  (This halves the size of typical files.)   XDECK
has since been generalized to operate beyond any specified column.

The user is prompted for the file name and the column beyond which
truncation is desired.  (The default is column 72.)  A next higher
version of the file is produced,  in which all trailing blanks  as
well as the requested columns are suppressed.   The original  file
is left intact.   [Under Linux: no version number means the output
file name is the input name with '.xdeck' appended.]

Also,  XDECK  will  now  handle  the  removal  of  leading columns
(designed for use with files disposed from the CRAY via the  CYBER
front-end).

Logical units:      1  for input  file
                    2  for output file
                    5  for terminal input
                    6  for terminal output

History: Original code on PDP-11:  David Saunders/Dan McCoy, 1/78.
         Added leading column removal option:    Greg Howe, 11/82.
         Patched "leading > length of short line" case: DAS 01/85.
         Patched to handle long records gracefully:     DAS 08/85.
         Added warning before first prompt:             RGL  1/86.

         Under Linux, version number treatment was not  DAS 10/13.
         appropriate.  Add .xdeck to the file name now.

         The style encountered here is no longer recommended!
         Carriage control in particular no longer uses '$'.
