PRECISION Description:

   This program drives the function-precision estimation routine
OBJEPS for a given function with calling sequence of the form

   CALL xxx (N, X, F)                    ! 'Q' for QNMDIF
   CALL xxx (MODE, N, X, F, G, NSTATE)   ! 'N' for NPSOL/NZSOL

Actually, the more recent forms, QNMDIF2 and NPOPT, now both expect

   CALL xxx (N, X, F, NCALL, FAIL)

and OBJEPS should be adjusted accordingly (no call for that yet at NASA).

This version examines the function F8PT3 from Example 8.3 of the
book PRACTICAL OPTIMIZATION.

See the optlib collection for OBJEPS.
