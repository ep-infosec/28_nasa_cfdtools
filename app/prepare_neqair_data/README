program prepare_neqair_data

   This adaptation of prepare_rapid_analysis prompts the user for specifics
   about a flow solution and the body point(s) at which radiative heating
   calculations are to be performed with NEQAIR, either in tangent-slab mode
   or full angular integration mode.  STRUCTURED GRIDS IN PLOT3D FORMAT ARE
   ASSUMED.  For the unstructured case, USLOS is available for constructing
   individual or hemispherical collections of lines of sight, but at the time
   of writing, interpolation of unstructured flow field data onto those lines
   of sight remains an issue, because US3D's nearest-cell (KDTREE-based) form
   of interpolation can choose wrong cell centroids in the presence of high-
   aspect ratio cells near a flow-field shock.

   The working directory should contain (or point to) the vertex-centered
   volume grid and associated flow data (temperature(s) & number densities).
   With the utilities that preceded SLOS, cell-centered volume grid and flow
   data could also be used, but the vertex-centered grid (without the fn.
   file) was still needed because the line-of-sight discretizations were
   derived from its off-wall grid lines.  In SLOS, the discretizations follow
   the two-stage scheme of DPLR (1-sided stretching with ds1, then 2-sided
   restretching with ds2mult applied to the 1-sided outermost interval).
   Use of VERTEX-CENTERED grid and function files is now recommended, but
   cell-centered data with "halo" cells will produce much the same result,
   as only the innner and outer layers at k = 1 and kmax are actually used.
   All these files should be in PLOT3D multiblock form, formatted or not.
   Whether they are 2D or 3D is automatically determined.

   If full integration is specified for a 2D axisymmetric case, 3D revolved
   grid and function files will be produced as part of the automation
   procedures of which the present utility is the first step following a
   flow calculation with the right choice of species.

   The output from this utility is a shell script named prepare_LOS_data that
   (when sourced) invokes the indicated utilities and control files (also
   generated here) to set up line-of-sight data in NEQAIR's LOS.dat form as
   LOS-1.dat, LOS-2.dat, ..., LOS-n.dat in the working directory.

   After the line(s) of sight have been checked for possible flaws (such as
   in the underlying line-surface intersection calculations), a separate
   script, set_neqair should be invoked with two first and last line number
   arguments.  This generates directories LINE-1, LINE-2 ... containing links
   to LOS-1.dat, LOS-2.dat ... as the LOS.dat expected by NEQAIR, and links
   to the appropriate neqair.inp control file, and to a neqair.pbs file.
   Another shell script can then launch NEQAIR within each LINE-* directory,
   and this script is system-dependent.

   Note that on the NAS supercomputer facility at Ames Research Center, an
   "array" job is recommended.  This automates looping over a range of
   indices (which can be the n in the LINE-n directories), with a limit of
   500 total at the time of writing.  E.g., neqair.1-325.pbs:

      #PBS -W group_list=xxxxx
      #PBS -q normal
      #PBS -l walltime=0:10:00
      #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=20:model=ivy
      #PBS -N neqair
      #PBS -j oe
      #PBS -J 1-325

      module use -a /home4/tsa/modulefiles
      module load neqair/15.0

      cd LINE-$PBS_ARRAY_INDEX
      mpiexec neqair < neqair.inp  > neqair.out

   Files neqair.inp and neqair.pbs are expected to be in the working
   directory along with the body point file (indices or coordinates) and a
   sample.LOS.dat file indicating the correct species, although the user
   can choose to proceed if any of neqair.inp, neqair.pbs, or sample.LOS.dat
   are missing.  The neqair_data step (los.* --> LOS.dat format) can then
   be performed explicitly at a later time.

   This neqair.pbs should not be confused with the array job (or alternative)
   shown above.  It should be set to run a single line only, and might be
   used in /LINE-1 as a check that all looks as it should before launching a
   job that loops over many lines.

   More about sample.LOS.dat (see NEQAIR_DATA):

      NEQAIR_DATA can now write line-of-sight (LOS) data in both the original
      rigid format read by NEQAIR versions up to and including v14 and the
      simpler column-oriented format handled from NEQAIR v15 on.  Both data
      formats involve a sample.LOS.dat file read here that indicates the
      species names.  If a sample file is found with a NEQAIR version number
      on line 1, then the later data format is indicated. The sample file is
      transcribed as the header of all output LOS data files in either case.

   When NEQAIR is run on a range of lines, its results will appear in
   neqair.out in subdirectores /LINE-1, /LINE-2, ...  A command such as
   grep Total LINE-*/neqair.out > qrad.dat followed by wc qrad.dat will
   confirm that all lines have run or that NEQAIR may have failed on some.
   The utility sort_rows is one way of ordering qrad.dat, using LINE- as
   the sort string, although grep may have a switch that overrides the
   default order of LINE-1, LINE-10, LINE-100, LINE-101, ...

   Full integration mode should work with a single body point per working
   directory.  Since actually performing the integration cannot occur
   until all the NEQAIR results are in hand, no attempt is made here to
   deal with the NEQAIR_INTEGRATION step, which is prompt-driven.

Site-Specifics:

   If this program is installed at another site, the following path should
   be edited appropriately prior to compiling and linking:

      /apps/pkgs/cfdtools/         ! See parameter constant "path" below

   It is assumed that all the utilities invoked here reside in subdirectories
   with uppercase names and this indicated path.

   E.g., lines_of_sight, flow_interp, ... should be installed here:

      /share/apps/cfdtools/LINES_OF_SIGHT/lines_of_sight
      /share/apps/cfdtools/FLOW_INTERP/flow_interp   and so on.

   The following utilities may be invoked by the script from this program:

   Originally:
      lines_of_sight       ! One or more lines of sight in a 3D volume grid
      lines_of_sight_2d    ! One or more lines of sight in a 2D volume grid
      hemispheres_of_sight ! Many lines of sight for one body point
      flow_interp          ! 3D flow interpolation at LOS coordinates
      flow_interp_2D       ! 2D   "    "    "    "    "    "    "
      neqair_data          ! PLOT3D *.g/*.f --> NEQAIR's LOS.dat form

   Currently:
      slos                 ! 1 or more lines, tangent-slab or hemi., 3D vol.
      lines_of_sight_2d    ! 1 or more tangent-slab lines in a 2D volume grid
      flow_interp          ! 3D flow interpolation at LOS coordinates
      flow_interp_2D       ! 2D   "    "    "    "    "    "    "
      neqair_data          ! PLOT3D *.g/*.f --> NEQAIR's LOS.dat form

      [The more recent SLOS utility was derived from USLOS (for unstructured
      grids).  Both of these combine the functions of the LINES_OF_SIGHT and
      HEMISPHERES_OF_SIGHT utilities, and make use of the diagonal of the
      volume grid bounding box for the line-surface intersection search
      intervals in place of earlier heuristics.  They also feature a more
      fail-safe (?) way of recovering from an intersection calculation that
      has failed because a line-surface distance isn't essentially zero.]

FLOW_INTERP Warning:

      Past practice has been to use FLOW_INTERP's hybrid method 3, because
      its original preferred method occasionally encounters a singular matrix
      believed to be associated with a high aspect ratio cell in a boundary
      layer.  The ADT search method now traps singularities and retries with
      a perturbed system guaranteed to be full rank.  Method 3 (nearest cell
      centroid search via KDTREE, followed by refinement within that cell)
      has been found to give seriously wrong interpolations occasionally by
      using cells with centroids outside the shock even though the target
      points are actually inside the shock.  This explains occasional NEQAIR
      failures:  low free-stream temperatures were being interpolated on to
      the line of sight inside the shock.  USE FLOW_INTERP METHOD 1 WHENEVER
      PRACTICAL; METHODS 2 OR 3 SHOULD BE CONFINED TO LAST RESORTS FOR REALLY
      LARGE VOLUME GRIDS.

Assumptions:

   The line-of-sight calculations assume that the grid has a single layer of
   blocks, with k = 1 at the geometry surface.
