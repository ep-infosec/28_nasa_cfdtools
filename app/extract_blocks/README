Description:

   EXTRACT_BLOCKS extracts a list of blocks from a multiblock grid and an
optional "q" file (or rather a PLOT3D-type function file).

   This version can handle "iblanked" files at the cost of another prompt.

Control file ('extract_blocks.inp'):

   This should contain a list of ascending block numbers, one per line.
E.g.:

   1
   3
   7

   15
