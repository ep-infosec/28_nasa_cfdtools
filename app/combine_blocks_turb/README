This COMBINE_BLOCKS variant is a work-around for local damage/repair flow
calculations involving turbulent solutions.  Actually, by dealing instead
with a variable number of species, it does not matter if the solutions are
laminar or turbulent.  [In the case of laminar solutions in air, disting-
uishing 1- and 2-temperature cases was feasible for cavity cases without
adding a prompt, but here a prompt is unavoidable.  (Jay Hyatt first added
a prompt for the number of turbulent flow variables in the function file,
but prompting for the number of species avoids the 5-species assumption.
Higher-level automated procedures are affected by the number of prompts.)
Note that only cavity cases (or protrusions that can mostly be treated as
for cavities) require the extra prompt in order to initialize flow within
the cavity.] 

For DPLR applications, turbulent flow variables should be the last ones in
the function file:

   turbulent eddy viscosity (mu_t) for algebraic turbulence models;
   mu_t, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), turbulent omega (omega_t) for SST

Velocity components are assumed to follow the species densities for cavity
cases.
