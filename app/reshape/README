PURPOSE:

   RESHAPE is a utility to transform (X,Y) data in one or more of
   a variety of ways such as scaling, rotating, reversing order, etc.
   Since X and Y may be in specified columns other than 1 and 2,
   RESHAPE can also serve the purpose of extracting two columns of
   data from many without other changes.

METHOD:

   > Deal with just one dataset at a time.  The formats chosen are
     those of program SMOOTH:

        [TITLE]             <Optional title, up to 80 characters>
        [N]                 <Optional no. of pts - EOF also serves>
                            <Blank lines are ignored>
        X (1)  Y (1)
         :     :            <X and Y may be extracted from specified
         :     :             columns if there are more than two>
         :     :
        ! X     Y           <! suppresses points or adds comments>
        X (N)  Y (N)

   > Transformations are done in-place (Y and/or X).

   > "Undo last" and "start over" operations are done with spare copies.

PROCEDURES:

   ALPHA     Distinguishes text and numeric data
   GETLINE   Gets next significant line
   OPENER    File opening utility
   RDLIST    Gets an indefinite number of integers
   RDXYZ     Gets 2 or 3 columns from many
   READER    Prompting utility (entry pts. READI, READR, etc.)

HISTORY:

   08/29/86   DAS   Initial implementation (in haste) -
                    simple Y-translation or scaling.
   09/03/86   DAS   Added rotation and X-translation/scaling.
   10/21/86   DAS   Using EOF to determine number of points turns
                    out to be inconvenient for other utilities.
                    Expect N to be with the data.  (Changed later.)
   08/19/88   DAS   Added option to reverse the order 1:N.
   10/21/88   DAS   Bug fix for reverse-order option; added
                    "start over", "switch X and Y", and
                    "reflect" options.
   10/13/92   DAS   Handled multi-column files with ! comments or
                    blank lines ignored.  N and title are now optional.
   01/03/98   DAS   Provided for rotating Y about (Zc=0, Yc).
   05/20/99   DAS   Minor Fortran 90 changes.
   08/30/10   DAS   The advance='no' prompting was misbehaving; added a
                    "Done" item to the menu.
   05/24/11   DAS   64-bit precision outputs now, not single precision.
   07/10/21   DAS   In order to test the revised CHANGEN2D, install
                    it as one more option here, as first done for testing
                    CHANGEN via RESHAPE3D.  Add saving of before and
                    after cell growth rates for this option.
