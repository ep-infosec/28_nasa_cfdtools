MERGE_FILES Description:

   Merge the contents of 2 Tecplot files which apply to the same structured
   grid (2-D or 3-D, same number of zones and same zone sizes).  The coord-
   inates are assumed to match, so only those from the first file are
   carried over.  The inputs must be ASCII files; the merged output may be
   ASCII or binary.  File types are deduced from their names (*.dat|*.plt),
   which are prompted for.  Zones are processed one at a time (no need to
   store more than one).
