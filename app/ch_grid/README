CH_GRID (C-H grid) is the stand-alone form of the automated wing/body
volume grid generator employed by the shape optimization code, SYN87-SB
(single-block/8 sub-block topology).  While that approach from the 1990s
(with its option to approximate the effects of engine nacelles) has been
superseded, this grid generator has seen reuse for modeling micro vehicles,
and may yet find other uses.

Please see the header of ch_grid.f for further details.
