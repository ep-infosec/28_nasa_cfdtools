P3D2TEC Description:

   Convert between PLOT3D and Tecplot file formats, in either direction.
   Structured multiblock grids in 3-space with optional function files are
   assumed.  File names are prompted for, and standard file extensions are
   used to distinguish between formatted and unformatted files.  Note that
   reading unformatted Tecplot files is not an option, though:

      *.g[u] [and *.f[u]]  <-->  *.dat | *.plt   in BLOCK or POINT order

   Blocks are processed one at a time (no need to store whole files).

   This version looks for an optional 'p3d2tec.inp.2' file if Tecplot
   output is implied.  This should contain the desired variable names
   "" delimited:

      "x, m"            [Just one per line]
      "y, m"
      "z, m"
      "Cp"
      "qw, W/cm^2"
      "T, K"
      "..."

   If this file is not found, or the wrong number of names is found, the
   function names default to "function 1", "function 2", ...

Option to Insert Arc Lengths:

   For the case of a flow solution interpolated along one or more lines of
   sight normal to the geometry (see LINES_OF_SIGHT and FLOW_INTERP by the
   present author, which work with PLOT3D files), it can be convenient to
   plot such profiles against distance from the wall.  Therefore, if all
   input blocks are found to be lines (only one dimension > 1), the user is
   prompted about an option to insert cumulative arc lengths after the "z"
   coordinate and before the first flow function variable.  The option is
   suppressed by entering an empty name for arc length.  Otherwise, enter
   something like "s, m" or "s, in".

History:

   11/22/06  D. A. Saunders  Initial implementation.
   11/27/06  "  "  "  "  "   Added the option to supply variable names.
                             The *.inp.2 file follows other utility usage.
   08/22/08  "  "  "  "  "   Added the option to insert arc lengths if the
                             input grid blocks all have only one dimension
                             greater than 1.
