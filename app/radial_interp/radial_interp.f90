   program Radial_Interp

!     This program performs specialized interpolations for hypersonic grids and/or flow fields.  The radial grid lines of volume
!     grids are assumed to extend from the body to the outer boundary for all blocks, and there should be only one layer of blocks.
!     This assumption allows rapid generation of volume grids from a given volume grid and a new surface grid.  The interpolation
!     coefficients readily determined for the new surface grid points are reused to grow the corresponding volume quantities out
!     from the surface parallel to the original radial lines.
!
!     All files are PLOT3D grid and function files, formatted or unformatted.
!
!  Options:
!
!     (1) Interpolate a new volume grid from a given volume grid and a new surface grid.
!         A flow field may optionally accompany the given grid and be interpolated to the new volume grid.
!         The given grid and optional flow solution may each be either vertex-centered or cell-centered.  Three of the implied
!         permutations are relevant:
!
!            (a) Vertex-centered grid + vertex-centered solution:  flow interpolations are vertex-centered
!            (b) Vertex-centered grid + cell  -centered solution:  input flow is moved to vertices; cell-centered flow is output
!            (c) Cell  -centered grid + cell  -centered solution:  treated as for (a) but output flow is really cell-centered
!
!         The new surface grid must be input as vertex-centered.  For case (c), its cell-centered form is derived here.
!         The output blocks contain the same number of radial points as the initial grid.
!         The degenerate case (nk = 1) is meaningful if a flow solution is present.
!
!     (2) Interpolate a flow solution from one grid to another ([largely] consistent) grid.
!         The grids and flow solutions may contain either volume data or surface data (only).
!         The case of surfaces is the same as for option (1) with a flow solution present.
!         In fact, option (2) is distinguished from option (1) by nk > 1 in the new target grid.
!         In the case of volume grids, the old and new numbers of radial points may differ.
!         Two sub-options are provided:
!
!            (i)  is suited to fully consistent radial lines;
!            (ii) is more general and is quite efficient if the radial lines are reasonably consistent.
!
!         Option (2) is intended for situations such as where the new mesh has had its outer boundary moved closer to the body.
!         Again, the new target grid must be input as vertex-centered.  If necessary, its cell-centered form is derived here.
!
!  Assumptions:
!
!     >  At solid wall boundaries (k = 1), all values are surface-cell-centered (no below-the-wall values).
!     >  The same underlying geometry is represented by both surface grids.  Any local discrepancies are small and corrected for.
!     >  The new surface may be a reduced region (as for rapid interpolation of damage/repair volume grids and/or solutions).
!
!  Usage for Surface Damage/Repair Applications:
!
!     Two runs of Radial_Interp are required if a new surface grid in the damage region is the starting point:
!
!     (1) Generate a new volume grid from the old volume grid and new surface (vertex-centered; no flow interpolation), followed by
!     (2) Interpolate a new solution from the cell-centered initial flow and grid, using the same new vertex-centered input surface.
!
!     Treating the cell-centered flow separately (with the cell-centered form of the grid) is preferable to combining runs (1) and
!     (2) because the runs are almost identical on different data.  A second reason is that the ADT search package cannot handle
!     more than one surface to be searched simultaneously.
!
!     Apart from avoiding unnecessary smearing of a finite volume flow solution during interpolation, the intended inclusion
!     of "halo" cells in the cell-centered grids and solutions enables proper handling of boundary conditions, both at the
!     solid wall and at the other outer boundaries of what could well be a reduced set of new grid blocks modeling localized
!     surface damage or repair.  These halo cells can define the (frozen) boundary conditions needed for updating the flow in the
!     damage region more efficiently than treating the entire configuration, without significant loss of accuracy.
!
!  Algorithm:
!
!     The assumptions allow use of surface searches (and possibly radial line searches) in place of volume searches, although
!     the more general option (ii) for flow field interpolation still uses 3-D searches along the new radial lines.
!
!     >  Read the full original volume (or surface) grid and associated flow solution if present.
!
!     >  If an output grid is implied, read the full new surface grid (vertex-centered) and establish common edge info.
!
!     >  If the solution is cell-centered but the grid is not, interpolate it to the grid vertices via averaging of neighbors.
!
!     >  If the grid and solution are both cell-centered, convert the target grid to cell-centered form.
!
!     >  Generate the ADT search tree from all patches of the new structured surface.
!
!     >  For each block of the new grid:
!
!        >  Read the new grid block (or copy it to the k = 1 plane if it is a surface already fully-read).
!
!        >  For each point (i,j) in the new k = 1 surface face:
!
!           >  Find the nearest original surface grid cell (ADT search).
!
!           >  Any target point further than the distance tolerance from the original surface grid may constitute erroneous usage,
!              but may also be the result of minor damage/repair; proceed anyway with the best surface cell found.
!
!           >  Interpolate the original grid and/or flow solution to the current new surface point (bilinear within a single cell).
!
!           >  If a volume grid is being generated,
!
!                 >  Apply the same interpolation coefficients to the successive k planes to produce the new radial grid line and
!                    corresponding flow if present.
!
!              Otherwise, if a flow field is being interpolated (not just a surface flow),
!
!                 >  If the radial lines are consistent,
!
!                       >  Build the new radial line using the old grid as a template.
!
!                    Otherwise (a little more generally),
!
!                       >  For each k > 1, use the old grid cell indices found for the previous k as good starting guesses for a
!                          RIPPLE3D search for the current k.
!
!                       >  Simple use of TRILINT-type volume interpolation will not suffice in the boundary layer.  Consider the
!                          case of a new grid simply twice as dense as the old grid:  a new in-between point at the surface could
!                          be significantly far away from the foot of the projection to the nearest surface cell in the old grid.
!                          This offset must be taken into account as we move off the new surface.  Thus, if x0 is the foot of the
!                          projected normal for the k = 1 point x1, then for k > 1 we really search for the adjusted point xk where
!                          xk = x(k) - (x1 - x0), not for x(k).
!
!        >  If the optional input flow was cell-centered and the grid was not, convert the interpolated flow to be cell-centered for
!           the new volume block.
!
!        >  Output the interpolated grid block and/or flow solution block.

!     newnk ds1 ds2fraction   Optional inputs to redistribute each radial line a la OUTBOUND.  GRID ONLY.  See NOTES below.
!
!     NOTES:  (1) dtol < 0 means decay surface mismatches to zero at the outer boundary, else apply the same dx/dy/dz at each k;
!                 note that the same differences is probably the right choice if the new surface adds curvature, esp. at k = 2.
!             (2) DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDISTRIBUTE THE RADIAL LINES IF A FLOW FILE IS PRESENT.  (One reason: Half-cell spacing at the wall.)
!             (3) If the optional last line is not present, the output radial distribution matches that of the input grid;
!                 Alternatively, enter newnk = 0 and ds1 = -99. to suppress redistribution.
!                 These optional controls allow changing the output nk (or not) and/or the output radial distribution:
!                 newnk = input nk is allowed (probably to impose a ds1 > 0.);
!                 newnk = 2 means the most likely case: double the point count in the k direction; e.g., 65 --> 129;
!                 newnk = 0 means the output nk is the same as the input nk;
!                 newnk = some sensible positive integer means change nk to that newnk; ds1 = -1. is probably the right choice;
!                 ds1 < -1. suppresses any redistribution;
!                 ds1 = -1. means preserve the input relative spacing (probably for a different nk);
!                 ds2 =  0. means preserve the input wall spacing;
!                 ds2 >  0. means a fixed wall spacing everywhere;
!                 ds2fraction is not used if ds1 = -1.;
!                 otherwise, ds2fraction is applied to the interim 1-sided stretching's outer spacing for 2-sided stretching

!  History:
!
!     04/13/04  DAS  Initial RADIAL_INTERP design:  James suggested adapting GRID_INTERP (also James's idea) as a specialized
!                    alternative to the fully general FLOW_INTERP.  It takes advantage of single-layer-of-blocks topologies.
!     04/14/04   "   Added output of interpolated surface grid as a check on the surface searching behavior.
!     04/16/04 DS/JR RIPPLE_SURF has been refined to balance the (p,q) and distance tolerances.
!     04/19/04   "   Count (p,q) deviations from the unit square and projected distances above tolerance separately;
!                    make the distance tolerance an input instead of some hard-coded fraction of the data range.
!     04/20/04  DAS  Merged the GRID_INTERP function into RADIAL_INTERP, which now produces grids and/or flow fields.
!     05/03/04   "   Added blanking capability: points near the open shuttle trailing edge were being mapped to the wrong surface.
!     05/20/04   "   Made extensions to ensure exact matches in common block faces of interpolated grids.  Very grubby!
!     05/25/04   "   Surface patch x/y/z extrema aren't always at an edge!  (Consider a wing tip cap.)
!     05/28/04   "   Replaced RIPPLE_SURF approach with ADT search scheme from Stanford.  (But RIPPLE3D is still used elsewhere.)
!     06/07/04   "   The ADT scheme now works directly with the structured grid (no need to repack the coordinates).
!     10/20/04   "   Any left-handed output blocks are now made right-handed by reversing the j indices.
!     11/24/04   "   Two new "cell-centered" inputs allow application to cell-centered flow interpolation (in a separate run
!                    from the grid interpolation) without too many complications.
!     01/19/05   "   Interpolating a flow solution with halo cells failed at the start of block 2.  The common edge point data
!                    apply to the new surface BEFORE recentering.  Not matching common points exactly for flow interpolation is OK.
!     03/24/05   "   Preserve outer boundaries precisely by decaying the adjustment of each new radial line at the surface.
!     05/02/05   "   Decaying can hurt at the outer boundary when higher resolution is specified at the surface.  Carrying any
!                    nonlinear effect of curvature at the surface all the way out can actually be preferable for smooth surfaces.i
!                    Quick fix for now; do it more carefully at the outer boundary some day.
!     06/21/06   "   dtol = -0.0001 (say - i.e., negative) can now be used to decay surface adjustments to zero at the outer
!                    boundary as is prefereable for shallow cavities treated as part of the main volume blocks.
!     01/28/11   "   Chun Tang wondered if an option could be provided to specify the spacing off the wall in the output grid.
!                    He had thin inner blocks whose outer spacing needed to be matched, but more conventional use on a single
!                    layer of blocks may benefit from such an option.  Therefore, look for ds1 and ds2fraction on an optional
!                    last line of the control file.  Optional blanking inputs expected there at one time have been removed.
!                    Initially, redistribute a vertex-centered grid only.  If the need arises for treating a flow solution
!                    similarly, it appears that (for each radial line) the cell-centered grid and flow would need to be converted
!                    to vertices, redistributed, then converted back.  Do that if it's ever called for.
!     08/07/13   "   All ADT variants are now in a single module with generic build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
!     03/19/18   "   Jeff Hill asked for an option to change the number of grid points in the radial direction, as convenient for
!                    the case of grid alignment within DPLR on a coarsened (say 222) then wanting to impose the next finer surface.
!                    This calls for a 111 volume output, not 112.  The optional last line of the control file now has three inputs,
!                    not two.  Only the grid is treated; expected usage allows FCONVERT to upsequence the flow solution.
!     03/22/18   "   The cases of an old (or no) optional last line in the control file did not turn off redistribution.
!                    To suppress redistribution, omit the last line or enter (say) newnk = 0 and ds1 = -99. with a ds2fraction.
!     03/23/18   "   The special case of newnk = 2 now means double the current k resolution, as in 65 --> 129.
!     04/27/18   "   The option to change nk, intended for vertex-centered grids only, led to unassigned flow interpolations.
!                    Changing nk was supposed to be disallowed for flow solutions all along.
!     10/21/20   "   Variable newnk was not being defined as [old] nk when a function file is present (redistribution disallowed).
!     11/7/20   JPH  Added flow solution redistribution logic. Fix bug in grid redistribution at the wall.

!  This routine interpolates an existing grid and/or flow solution to [one block of] a new surface or volume grid, under certain
!  assumptions listed in the Radial_Interp main program, q.v.  Briefly, a hypersonic flow grid is assumed, with all radial lines
!  extending from the k = 1 surface to the outer boundary (one layer of blocks only).
!
!  As with the earlier flow_interp and interp_q, this scheme handles cell-centered or vertex-centered flow solutions, assumes the
!  surface grids match very closely, and treats one new block at a time so the calling program can avoid storing more than that
!  if there is no real need to do so.
!
!  04/13/04  DAS  Initial adaptation of ideas from grid_interp and flow_interp.
!  04/14/04   "   Added interpolated surface grid output.
!  04/15/04   "   RIPPLE_SURF has DWEIGHT and ERROR arguments now.
!  04/19/04   "   Distinguish the counts of surface searches out of tolerance w.r.t. (p,q) from those exceeding dtol;
!                 make dtol an input rather than some hard-coded fraction of the data range.
!  04/20/04   "   Merged the GRID_INTERP functionality in with the flow interpolation options, at some cost in clarity.
!  05/03/04   "   Added blanking capability.
!  05/24/04   "   Made use of connectivity data to ensure that common edge results match exactly for a new volume grid.
!  05/28/04   "   Replaced RIPPLE_SURF with the ADT surface search scheme from Stanford.
!  06/02/04   "   Introduced x/y/zcorner(*) to overcome the fact that any number of patches may have a common corner point.
!  06/07/04   "   The ADT scheme now works directly with the structured grid (no need to repack the coordinates).
!  01/19/05   "   Added recenter_g argument to enable skipping use of common edge data when flows with halo cells are treated.
!  03/24/05   "   Preserve outer boundaries precisely by decaying the adjustment at the surface.
!  05/02/05   "   Decaying can hurt at the outer boundary when higher resolution is specified at the surface.  Carrying any
!                 nonlinear effect of curvature at the surface all the way out can actually be preferable.  Quick fix for now;
!                 do it more carefully at the outer boundary some day.
!  06/21/06   "   dtol = -0.0001 (say - i.e., negative) can now be used to decay surface adjustments to zero at the outer
!                 boundary as is prefereable for shallow cavities treated as part of the main volume blocks.
!  01/28/11   "   Remnants of inactive blanking have been removed.  An option to redistribute the points along each new radial line
!                 has been added (extra step for each radial line).
!  08/07/13   "   All ADT variants are now in a single module with generic build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
!  03/19/18   "   Allow for changing the number of points in the radial direction.
