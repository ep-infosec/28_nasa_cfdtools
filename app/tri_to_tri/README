Program tri_to_tri description:

   Interpolate one unstructured surface flow solution to another in 3-space.
This is an adaptation of the earlier TRI_TO_QUAD, replacing the structured
target surface grid with a surface triangulation.  Both assume that the
input dataset is a single-zone surface triangulation.  Here, the target (and
hence output) triangulation may contain one or more zones.

Input Tecplot data format (original, vertex-centered):

   VARIABLES = "X", "Y", "Z", "TEMP", "PRESS", "CP", "MACHE", "ASOUNDE", ...
   ZONE N=96000, E=32000, F=FEPOINT, ET=TRIANGLE

Control file format (standard input):

   TRI_TO_TRI control file
   xxxx.xxx        ! Surface triangulation and flow solution (Tecplot format)
   1               ! 1 => vertex-centered/Tecplot; 2 => cell-centered/Tecplot
   xxxx.xxx        ! Target grid (Tecplot multizone surface triangulation)
   T               ! T|F = formatted|unformatted
   xxxx.xxx        ! Output file (Tecplot multizone surface triangulation)
   T               ! T|F = formatted|unformatted
   0.0001          ! Distance tolerance for target pt. inside solution grid
  [7.890     0.    ! Optional X & F; if x > X, set finterp(:) = F]

Method:

   >  The surface triangulation is read as a single zone and converted to an
      ADT (Alternating Digital Tree) for search purposes.  If the function
      values are cell-centered, they are interpolated to the cell vertices
      first.  No unique best interpolation method exists.  The area-weighted
      averaging used here suffices for typical triangulations.
   >  Target zones are processed in order (read and written as needed).
   >  For each target point, the ADT search locates the nearest point on the
      surface triangulation (never outside it).  The function values can then
      be interpolated with the indicated trilinear coefficients.
   >  Optionally, target points beyond the indicated X will be set to the
      indicated F (probably zero, as for radiation on an aft body).

History:

   03/07/05  DAS  Initial TRI_TO_QUAD for vertex-centered function data.
   08/29/08   "   Added optional X and F to deal with radiative heating
                  that goes to zero beyond some X for CEV.
   03/15/10   "   Provided for DPLR/Overset-related triangulated input data
                  (type 2, cell-centered Tecplot format).
   08/08/13   "   All ADT variants are in one module now with generic
                  build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
   07/03/14   "   TRI_TO_TRI adapted from TRI_TO_QUAD.
