Description for program triangulation_tool:

   Read one surface triangulation file, perform the indicated analysis or
analyses, and (if indicated) save the result as another triangulation.
Initially, this serves as a driver for testing geometric property additions
to triangulation_io.f90.

   The triangulation may contain more than one zone (but probably doesn't).

   No control file is needed - just some prompts.

Input Tecplot data format (vertex-centered):

    If, as in this example, each hex cell is actually formed by duplicating
    vertex 3 of a tetrahedron as vertex 4, and vertex 4 as vertices 6,7,8,
    then volumes are treated as single tetrahedra -- not as 5 or 6 of them.

History:

   10/17/14  DAS  Initial adaptation of TRI_TO_TRI as a driver for applying
                  geometric utilities that have been added to the surface
                  triangulation module triangulation_io.f90:
                  x/y/z/data ranges, surface area, and enclose volume.
                  Further extensions are expected.
   10/20/14   "   More geometric options along the lines of ADJUST_GRID.
   10/21/14   "   Surface enter of mass and moments of inertia options.
   11/17/14   "   Volume grid analogues of the triangulation utilities have
                  been added to triangulation_io.f90 and are driven here.
