SURFACE_DIFFS Description:

   Map each point of a first ("current") surface solution to a second
   ("previous") surface (possibly the same grid, but not necessarily),
   and output the first surface grid with the differenced solution for
   the specified variable (one variable per run).

   The surface solutions are expected to be structured Tecplot datasets.
   Input files must be ASCII; outputs may be ASCII (.dat) or binary (.plt).

   The difference distribution is written as a 2-variable dataset:

      (1)  first - second                  (signed differences)
      (2)  100*(first - second)/|first|    (signed percentage differences)

   Tabulations of minimum & maximum differences are also provided by block.

Possible uses:

   >  convergence testing for solutions n iterations apart on the same grid
   >  grid resolution comparisons
   >  other kinds of perturbed-surface comparisons

   The variable treated is likely to be surface pressure, temperature, or
   heat flux.  See also the earlier BUMP_FACTORS program if ratios rather
   than differences are preferred.  SURFACE_INTERP may also be relevant.

Sample control file (standard input):

   SURFACE_DIFFS control file
   qw, W/m^2   ! Function name for plottable results
   3           ! Function in current (first) dataset to treat
   3           ! Function in previous (second) dataset to compare with
   0           ! 1 = flip y of current data
   1.0000      ! Scale applied to current function
               ! Current file first, previous file 2nd, output 3rd
   CFD06_10000.dat
   CFD06_9500.dat
   CFD06_10000-9500.dat  ! Use *.plt to get binary output
