The KDTREE software, used in this collection by program FLOW_INTERP, is the
open source package made available by Matthew Kennel (kdtree2.f90, without
change, and test program kdree2_test.f90 that has been edited slightly for
clarity).

Working with distances in k dimensions, and efficient search trees, this
package provides what is surely the fastest possible means of determining
the nearest data point neighbor(s) to a given target point in k-space.

For searching computational meshes, the nearest grid point (cell centroid?)
may or may not be good enough.  For more precise interpolations within the
best cell, see the Alternating Digital Tree module in the adt library, and
the nearly 20 applications of it among the present collection of utilities.

FLOW_INTERP, for instance, makes use of both approaches.
