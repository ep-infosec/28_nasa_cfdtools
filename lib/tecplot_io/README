Module Tecplot_io_module provides utilities for reading 2- or 3-space
structured multiblock (multizone) grids and associated function data in
Tecplot format:

   public :: Tecplot_read       ! Read  an entire structured Tecplot file
   public :: Tecplot_write      ! Write an entire structured Tecplot file

   public :: Tec_header_read    ! Read  Tecplot file header records
   public :: Tec_header_write   ! Write Tecplot file header records
   public :: Tec_block_allocate ! Allocate the array fields for one block
   public :: Tec_block_read     ! Read  one block of a structured file
   public :: Tec_block_write    ! Write one block of a structured file

   public :: clone_header       ! Derive one dataset header from another
   public :: clone_zone         ! Derive one zone (block) from another
   public :: deallocate_header  ! Deallocate any dataset auxiliaries
   public :: deallocate_blocks  ! Deallocate arrays of indicated blocks

A superset of the derived data type employed by xyzq_io.f90 for PLOT3D-type
files is included in tecplot_io.f90 to accommodate zone header information,
along with a file header derived data type.


For unstructured surface data with triangular elements, a Tecplot_tri_io
module is also available:

   public :: Tecplot_tri_read   ! Read  1 dataset (+ header on call 1)
   public :: Tecplot_tri_write  ! Write 1   "     "     "     "     "


See also a later module for surface triangulations under the heading
triangulation_io (also Tecplot-specific).
