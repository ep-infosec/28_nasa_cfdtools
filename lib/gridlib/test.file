This gridlib collection has arisen from decades of application programming
at NASA Ames Research Center involving (mostly) structured grids in 2- and
3-space, including many utilities for generating grid point distributions
along a line or curve.  Of these, curvature-based and (extremely precise)
Vinokur-type distributions are most valuable.  See program DISTRIBUTE for
driving such utilities.  Transfinite interpolation, elliptic smoothing, and
grid perturbations are also supported here.

   Compilation warning:  vertices_to_centers[_2d].f90 use the module in
   grid_block_structure.f90, which can be found in subdirectory /xyzq_io.
