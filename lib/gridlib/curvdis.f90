!
!     Acronym:  CURVature-based DIStribution (2-space)
!               ----            ---
!     Purpose:
!
!        CURVDIS redistributes points along a curve in 2-space which is
!     represented by a discrete dataset, not necessarily monotonic, such
!     that the local spacing is inversely proportional to the local
!     curvature (with adjustments to handle the low curvature regions).
!     CURVDIS is intended for geometric applications where the coord-
!     inates have comparable units, although it may be used for non-
!     geometric purposes as well (e.g. plotting applications).  In both
!     cases, if the units of the curve coordinates are large (producing
!     small values of curvatures), the coordinates should be normalized
!     to the range [0,1].  For geometric curves, only one of the coord-
!     inate axes should be scaled to [0,1] and the other axis should be
!     scaled such that the true geometric shape is retained.
!
!     Method:
!
!        Given the availability of subroutine ARBDIS for translating
!     arbitrary "shape" functions into 1-D distributions whose spacing
!     at any abscissa is proportional to the shape function at that
!     abscissa, the problem then is to set up a shape function related
!     to curvature; ARBDIS does the rest.  (Abscissas in this case are
!     measures of arc length along the curve, and the shape function is
!     defined at each of the original data points.)
!        The subroutine is passed NDAT coordinates (XDAT, YDAT), of the
!     curve, for which it computes the cumulative arc lengths (or more
!     precisely, the cumulative chord lengths), s(n).  Next, FD12K is
!     called twice to compute the 2nd derivatives (d2x/ds2 and d2y/ds2)
!     in order to approximate the local curvatures' magnitudes, k(s),
!     which are given by:
!
!        (1)   k(s) = sqrt((d2x/ds2)**2 + (d2y/ds2)**2)
!
!        A direct inverse proportionality would yield a shape function
!     with smaller spacings in regions of larger curvature.  However,
!     for straight segments of the curve where k(s) = 0., a simple
!     inverse proportionality such as shape(s) = 1./k(s) would produce
!     an infinite local spacing.  Therefore, some arbitrary constant
!     (say 1.) should be added to k(s) in the denominator.
!        Clustering may be controlled by raising this fraction to some
!     exponent in the range [0,1].  0 would produce shape(s) = 1., or
!     uniform spacing; 1 would yield "direct" inverse proportionality
!     spacing; and an exponent in between (0,1) would produce spacings
!     between these two extremes.  Thus, our spacing function becomes:
!
!         (2)   shape(s) = [1./(k(s) + 1.)]**exponent
!
!        After the relative spacings (defining the shape function) are
!     calculated from eqn. (2), an option is provided to smooth the
!     shape function to reduce abrupt changes observed in sphere/cone
!     capsule defining sections.  The ARBDIS utility is then called to
!     compute redistributed arc lengths for the specified number N of
!     output points.  A further option is provided to smooth those
!     arc-lengths (with index-based abscissas) as also found desirable
!     for sphere/cone applications.  LCSFIT then serves to evaluate the
!     new X-Y coordinates corresponding to the new arc lengths.
!
!        This version also has the option to constrain cell growth rates
!     by smoothing them until they lie within [0.8, 1.2].  In order not
!     to change the calling sequence, ISMOOTH < 0 invokes that option,
!     as it also does for the vertex-capturing option.
!
!        NO: Constraining growth rates is a bad idea, defeating the
!     purpose of curvature-based spacing.  ISMOOTH < 0 is now used
!     instead to specify special treatment of sharp corners.
!
!        LATER:  ISMOOTH < 0 also controls broadening of high-curvature
!     regions onto flat/low curvature segments as found desirable in
!     flow calculations for entry capsules at the shoulder.
