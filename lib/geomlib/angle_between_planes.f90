   subroutine angle_between_planes (p1, p2, p3, q1, q2, q3, fixed_p, angle)

!  Determine the angle between two planes, where each plane is defined by the
!  vertices of one triangle.  The triangles may or may not have a common edge.
!
!  The desired angle is the angle between vectors normal to the triangles.
!  Thus an existing unit normal utility is made use of.  If the planes are
!  parallel, the result could be either 0 or 180 degrees, depending on the
!  order of the vertices in the two triangles (application-dependent).
!
!  Provision is made for not recomputing the first normal if only the second
!  triangle is changing between calls.
!
!  It is up to the application to avoid passing a degenerate triangle (with
!  two vertices identical, meaning the angle is undefined).
