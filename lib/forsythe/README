The FORSYTHE library is retained for historical reasons.
It corresponds to the Forsythe, Malcolm and Moler textbook from the early
1970s.  Most of the routines have been improved upon in other collections
such as /linsys and /optlib and /interplib here.

The version of DECOMP here differs from the /linsys version in that it
estimates condition number cond (A), which is often not needed.
