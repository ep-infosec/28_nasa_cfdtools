This Optimal Interpolation module provides a powerful means of treating
unstructured datasets in n-space, whether they be clouds of points from
laser scans of some objects, irregularly spaced function values that need
interpolating to new target independent variables, or whatever.  It belongs
in the family of methods best known as Kriging, which determine the linear
combination of neighboring data points that minimizes each interpolation
error in some sense under certain statistical assumptions (hence the use
of the term optimal).

Alexander Barth (originally: abarth@marine.usf.edui, now: a.barth@ulg.ac.be and
barth.alexander@gmail.com) kindly made the original package available under the
terms of the BSD 2-Clause License.  The present version has been adapted
considerably as explained in the header of the file optimal_interpolation.f90.
In particular, it offers a simpler inverse-distance-weighting option that
should be helpful during application development, given the number of "knobs"
to turn in order to get satisfactory results with the more sophisticated
method.

See program ANCHOR or Radio_Blackout elsewhere for a sample application.
