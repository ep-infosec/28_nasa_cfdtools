   subroutine circular_arc (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, r, n, xc, yc)

!  Evaluate the 2-space coordinates of n points distributed uniformly along a
!  circular arc as defined by two tangential points 1 and 2 and the point 3
!  where those tangents meet.  The associated radius is unique (and returned).
!  Point 3 must be equidistant from points 1 and 2 (assumed).
!
!  ALTERNATIVELY:  If the radius argument is input as a positive value, make
!                  that the circle radius instead of deriving the radius from
!  the implied tangent length.  This is checked for first, and if so, derive
!  the tangent length then proceed as for the original option.  The input
!  coordinates for points 1 and 2 should still be equidistant from the vertex
!  (because of tests for which side of the vertex to put the circle) but they
!  can be anywhere on the underlying tangents.  The radius argument is returned
!  as the implied tangent length in this case, for the convenience of the
!  calling program.
!
!  This functionality was prompted by a requirement to round angular vertices in
!  generatrices for the aft bodies of axisymmetric capsules (entry vehicles).
!  It may find other applications.

!  Local constants:

   real, parameter :: half = 0.5, zero = 0.

!  Local variables:

   integer :: i
   real    :: costheta, da, db, dtheta, l1, l2, t, theta, ux, uy, &
              xa, xb, xcenter, xm, xl, xr, ya, yb, ycenter, ym, yl, yr, &
              v1(2), v2(2)
   logical :: radius_in_tangent_out

!  Execution:

   radius_in_tangent_out = r > zero

   if (radius_in_tangent_out) then  ! Use it rather than derive it
      v1(1) = x3 - x1;  v1(2) = y3 - y1;  l1 = sqrt (dot_product (v1, v1))

      yr = y3 - t*uy
   else  ! Calculate the implied radius

!  The circle center along the radius through point 1 will be closer to
!  point 2 for one of two possibilities, so we compute both and pick one:

   ux = (x3 - xl) / t  ! Unit vector along the tangent
   uy = (y3 - yl) / t

   xa = xl + r*uy;  ya = yl - r*ux;  da = distance (xa, ya, xr, yr)
   xb = xl - r*uy;  yb = yl + r*ux;  db = distance (xb, yb, xr, yr)

   if (radius_in_tangent_out) r = t  ! Can be used by the calling program

   if (da < db) then
       xcenter = xa;  ycenter = ya
   else
       xcenter = xb;  ycenter = yb
   end if

   dtheta = (theta + theta) / real (n-1)

!  Rotating the radius through point 1 about the center clockwise and
!  anticlockwise will come closer to point 2 one way or the other:

   xa = xl;  ya = yl
   call rotate2d (1, xa, ya,  theta, xcenter, ycenter)
   da = distance (xa, ya, xr, yr)

   xb = xl;  yb = yl
   call rotate2d (1, xb, yb, -theta, xcenter, ycenter)
   db = distance (xb, yb, xr, yr)

   if (da > db) dtheta = -dtheta

!  Discretize the arc by rotating point 1 about the circle center:

   xc(:) = xl;  yc(:) = yl

   do i = 2, n - 1
      theta = dtheta * real (i-1)
      call rotate2d (1, xc(i), yc(i), theta, xcenter, ycenter)
   end do

   xc(n) = xr;  yc(n) = yr

   contains

      real function distance (xl, yl, xr, yr)  ! Obvious purpose and arguments

      real, intent (in) :: xl, yl, xr, yr

      distance = sqrt ((xl - xr)**2 + (yl - yr)**2)

      end function distance
