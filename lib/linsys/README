The linsys utilities deal with linear systems of equations (square or
over- or underdetermined).  All except LSQR and SYMMLQ use direct (non-
iterative) factorization methods. Only LSQR and SYMMLQ are suited to large
sparse systems.

For overdetermined linear least squares problems, Ax ~ b, the QR
factorization method of HDESOL and its relatives is recommended over
the commonly used normal equations method (A'Ax = A'b) as the orthogonal
factorization does not square the condition number of the LHS matrix the
way forming A'A does.

For underdetermined linear least squares, the method of HDECOM + HSULVE
provides the shortest-length solution.

Most recently (10-16-2019), safeguarded_lsqr.f90 has been added as a
workaround for possible matrix singularity in a 3x3 Newton iteration.
It ensures full rank for any matrix A(m,n).
