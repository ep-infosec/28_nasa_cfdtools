C
      SUBROUTINE INTERVAL (NX, X, XFIND, ARROW, LEFT)
C
C     One-liner: Interpolation search for interval containing a point.
C     ----------
C
C     Description and usage:
C     ----------------------
C
C        Written primarily for interval-based interpolations such as
C     piecewise linear or cubic spline, INTERVAL performs a search to
C     locate the best interval for evaluating the interpolant at a
C     given point. The normal case returns the "left-hand" endpoint of
C     the interval bracketing the point, but for the out-of-range cases
C     below or above the range of the knots, the interval to be used is
C     the first or last. The array of knots must be monotonic, either
C     increasing or decreasing. Diagrammatically, LEFT is returned as
C     shown below for the normal case (no extrapolation):
C
C          X (1)  ...   X (LEFT)   X (LEFT+1)   ...      X (NX)
C                                ^
C                              XFIND
C
C     And for extrapolation:
C
C                     X (LEFT = 1)  ...   X (NX)
C             ^
C           XFIND
C
C     or,
C                X (1)  ...   X (LEFT = NX-1)    X (NX)
C                                                           ^
C                                                         XFIND
C
C     If the point to be bracketed (XFIND) matches one of the knots, the
C     index of that knot is returned as LEFT, i.e., the condition for a
C     bracket of an interior point is:
C
C        X (LEFT) <= XFIND < X (LEFT+1)  if  ARROW = +1.0,  or
C        X (LEFT) >= XFIND > X (LEFT+1)  if  ARROW = -1.0.
C
C        This is a low-level routine with minimal error checking. The
C     calling program is assumed to have verified the following:
C
C     (1)  NX >= 2
C     (2)  X strictly monotonic
C     (3)  ARROW = +1.0 or -1.0
C
C     Subroutine PROTECT is available from the author for easily checking
C     conditions (2) and (3). LEFT is verified on input, but efficiency in
C     loops will benefit from passing the best estimate available, usually
C     just the result of the last call.
C
C        INTERVAL was originally written for use with CSEVAL and TABLE1.
C     The interpolation search was adapted from ideas in Sedgewick's book
C     referenced below.
C
C     Arguments:
C     ----------
C
C     Name  Dimension  Type  I/O/S  Description
C     NX                I    I      Number of points in array X; must
C                                   be >= 2 (no check performed).
C
C     X        NX       R    I      Array of points defining the set
C                                   of intervals to be examined. Only
C                                   the first NX-1 points are required.
C
C     XFIND             R    I      The point for which a bracketing
C                                   interval is sought.
C
C     ARROW             R    I      Monotonicity indicator for input
C                                   array X:
C                                     -1.0  strictly decreasing
C                                      0.0  NOT ALLOWED!
C                                     +1.0  strictly increasing
C                                   Supplied by the calling routine for
C                                   reasons of speed (not checked).
C
C     LEFT              I    I/O    Input: guessed index of left-hand
C                                   endpoint of the interval containing
C                                   the specified point.
C
C                                   Output: index of the largest array
C                                   value <= specified point (if ARROW=+1.0).
C                                   Special case for data out of range:
C                                   return left endpoint of closest interval.
C                                   Thus, LEFT = 1 for XFIND < X (2), and
C                                   LEFT = NX-1 for XFIND >= X (NX-1).
C                                   (If ARROW=-1.0, reverse the inequalities.)

C     Notes:
C     ------
C
C     (1)  IMPLICIT NONE and eight character symbols are not (yet) standard.
C
C     (2)  In speed-critical applications, it might be a good idea to build
C          this algorithm in-line since it is typically called many times
C          from within a loop. Another potential speed-up is removal of the
C          ARROW multiplies, which restricts the method to increasing data.
C          So far, the simplicity of separating out the messy search details
C          and the generality of bi-directional searching have outweighed
C          the modest speed penalty incurred.

C     Execution.
C     ----------

      XBYARROW = XFIND * ARROW

C     Simplify things by disposing of two important special cases so that
C     X (LEFT) and X (RIGHT) can really bracket XFIND. As a by-product,
C     this also takes care of the NX = 2, 3 cases.

      NXLESS1 = NX - 1

      IF (XBYARROW .GE. X (NXLESS1) * ARROW) THEN
         LEFT = NXLESS1
         GO TO 990
      ELSE IF (XBYARROW .LT. X (2) * ARROW) THEN
         LEFT = 1

C      ---------------------------------

C     Adjust the pointers. We hope that the calling routine has provided
C     a reasonable guess (since it's probably working on an ordered array
C     of points to evaluate), but check anyway.

      LEFT = MIN (MAX (2, LEFT), NX - 2)

      IF (XBYARROW .GE. X (LEFT) * ARROW) THEN
         IF (XBYARROW .LT. X (LEFT + 1) * ARROW) THEN

C           XFIND is in the original guessed-at interval.

            GO TO 990
         ELSE

C           We'll look farther to the right. Evidently LEFT was < NX - 2.

            RIGHT = NXLESS1
            LEFT  = LEFT + 1
         END IF
      ELSE

C        Look to the left of the guess. Evidently LEFT was > 2.

         RIGHT = LEFT
         LEFT  = 2
      END IF

C      ----------------------------------
C     |                                  |
C     |   2 <= LEFT < RIGHT <= NX - 1    |
C     |                                  |
C      ----------------------------------

C     The interval length must decrease each time through - terminate
C     when the correct interval is found or when the interval length
C     cannot be decreased.

   10 CONTINUE
         LENGTH = RIGHT - LEFT
         IF (LENGTH .GT. 1) THEN

C           The trial value is a "linear" estimate of the left-hand endpoint
C           of the interval bracketing the target XFIND, with protection
C           against round-off (which can affect convergence).

            TRIAL = MIN (RIGHT - 1, LEFT + MAX (0, INT (REAL (LENGTH) *
     &         (XFIND - X (LEFT)) / (X (RIGHT) - X (LEFT)))))

C            ------------------------------------------

C           Adjust pointers. Increase LEFT or decrease RIGHT until done.

            IF (XBYARROW .GE. X (TRIAL + 1) * ARROW) THEN
               LEFT  = TRIAL + 1
            ELSE IF (XBYARROW .LT. X (TRIAL) * ARROW) THEN
               RIGHT = TRIAL
            ELSE

C              We're done: XFIND is in the interval [X (TRIAL), X (TRIAL+1)).

               LEFT  = TRIAL
               GO TO 990
