DT_NURBS V2.1 software was obtained from the David Taylor Naval Research
Center in 1992 for use in the Applied Aerodynamics Branch at NASA Ames
Research Center on airfoil shape optimization.

There are two machine-dependent routines, dtjcon and dtmcon, that a new
user may need to adjust.

See also the aa_nurbs library of supplemental utilities and the BSPROFILE
application program.
