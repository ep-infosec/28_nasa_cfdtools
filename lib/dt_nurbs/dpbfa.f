      SUBROUTINE DPBFA(ABD,LDA,N,M,INFO)
      INTEGER LDA,N,M,INFO
      DOUBLE PRECISION ABD(LDA,*)
C
C     DPBFA FACTORS A DOUBLE PRECISION SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE
C     MATRIX STORED IN BAND FORM.
C
C     DPBFA IS USUALLY CALLED BY DPBCO, BUT IT CAN BE CALLED
C     DIRECTLY WITH A SAVING IN TIME IF  RCOND  IS NOT NEEDED.

C        ABD     DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                THE MATRIX TO BE FACTORED.  THE COLUMNS OF THE UPPER
C                TRIANGLE ARE STORED IN THE COLUMNS OF ABD AND THE
C                DIAGONALS OF THE UPPER TRIANGLE ARE STORED IN THE
C                ROWS OF ABD .  SEE THE COMMENTS BELOW FOR DETAILS.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY  ABD .

C        N       INTEGER
C                THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX  A .
