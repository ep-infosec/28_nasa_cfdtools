This modest collection of numerical quadrature utilities contains just one
2-D subroutine; the rest are for 1-D datasets, where the monotonic option
of LCSQUAD is recommended (or LCSAREAS if partial integrals are required
as for heat load time histories).  See also TRAPEZOIDAL_RECURSION in the
NUMODULES collection for the integrals associated with means and standard
deviations.

avint.f       Early approach involving averages of pairs of quadratic fits
csquad.f      Special formulation suited only to CSFIT spline coefficients
fsquad.f      Integrates a function in finite Fouries series form
integrate.f   Drives most of the 1-D utilities here on 1 or more datasets
lcsareas.f    Variant of LCSQUAD for time histories and partial sums
lcsquad.f     Quadrature of [mono.] local cubic spline fits; any interval
msquad.f      Earlier variant for cubic spline coefs. from MSFIT or CSFIT
quanc8rc.f    Reverse communicn. form of adaptive QUANC8 (Forsythe, et al.)
sctrpz.f      Quadrature on [x(1), x(n)] via the composite trapezoidal rule
