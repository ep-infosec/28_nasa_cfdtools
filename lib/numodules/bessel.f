      FUNCTION BESSEL (J, H, DEL)
C
C     One-liner: First derivative using central 3-point formula
C     ----------
C
C     Description and usage:
C     ----------------------
C
C        Computes a first derivative approximation using the central
C     3-point formula.  The data must be in the form of arrays containing
C     finite difference interval lengths and 2-point forward difference
C     derivatives.  BESSEL is intended to be used by PLSFIT for determin-
C     ing end conditions on an interval for (non-monotonic) interpolation
C     by piecewise cubics.  See the PLSFIT header for more details.

C
C     Name    Type/Dimension  I/O/S  Description
C     J       I               I      Indicates at which end of the
C                                    interval the derivative is to be
C                                    estimated. J = 0 means left-hand
C                                    side, J = 1 means right.
C
C     H       R (-1:1)        I      Array of interval lengths. The 0th
C                                    element is the length of the interval
C                                    on which the cubic is to be deter-
C                                    mined.
C
C     DEL     R (-1:1)        I      Array of derivative estimates. The
C                                    0th element is the forward difference
C                                    derivative over the interval on which
C                                    the cubic is to be determined.
C                                     
C     BESSEL  R                 O    The function value is the adjusted
C                                    derivative.
