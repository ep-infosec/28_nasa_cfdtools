The numodules library contains miscellaneous numerical utilities such as
those used for finite difference derivatives, means & standard deviations,
and linear transformations.

One of the more recent additions, TRAPEZOID_RECURSION, implements the
recurrence relations for a time series mean and standard deviation using
the trapezoidal rule for quadrature as opposed to the rectangle rule.
It was prompted by the need to visualize averaged data in the unsteady
wake flow behind atmospheric entry vehicles.  This method avoids the
potentially large sums encountered over thousands of flow iterations by
the straightforward method.
